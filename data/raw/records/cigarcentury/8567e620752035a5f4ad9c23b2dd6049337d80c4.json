The final blend is the end result of a painstaking process in which countless blends were tested, retested and tested again by a tasting panel comprised of several cigar aficionados. DBL Habano features a stunning Ecuador Habano wrapper, a Dominican binder and a filler blend of Dominican and Nicaraguan tobacco."}
