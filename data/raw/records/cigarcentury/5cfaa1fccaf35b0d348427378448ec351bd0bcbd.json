This subtle to medium-bodied handmade combines an all-Mexican blend of long-fillers inside a Mexican binder. Throw in some meaty big-ring sizes and you have an eventful slow-burner that won’t break the bank. Expect a surprisingly zesty little blend that’s mellow in character, offering notes of earth and sweet pepper with a long and satisfying finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"1999","ratingOutOf100":80},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"1997","ratingOutOf100":82}]}
