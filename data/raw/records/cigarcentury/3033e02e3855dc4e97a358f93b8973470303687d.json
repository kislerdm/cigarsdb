They first got into the game in the 19th century cultivating tobacco in the Pinar Del Rio Valley of Cuba. The Casa Cuevas Maduro is slightly dialed back from its habano counterpart, clocking in at a nice medium-body. The blend is highlighted by a naturally fermented Mexican San Andres wrapper atop a Nicaraguan binder, and long-fillers from Colombia, Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua. The maduro wrapper provides immense natural sweetness that comes and goes, along with balanced notes of spice, chocolate, cedar, citrus, and earth. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
