In 2007, the brand was acquired by Zander-Greg Inc., and it saw a resurgence in popularity. Since then Nat Cicco expanded its product line \nIn 1965, the first Nat Cicco cigar brand came to market with the less-than-dignified name “Rejects.” These machine-bunched, hand-rolled, medium-filler cigars were aimed at budget conscious consumers under the pretense of being “factory rejects,” and sold at bargain prices. Things changed in 2012 when Nat Cicco created a line of handmade, long-filler cigars called Nat Cicco Aniversario 1965, made in honor of the brand’s humble beginnings. The No. 4 Churchill is made with an Ecuador Habano cover leaf and pigtail cap. If the idea was to complete the portfolio with a serious cigar, they succeeded with the Churchill, showing that a company once known for rejects can produce a winning smoke."}
