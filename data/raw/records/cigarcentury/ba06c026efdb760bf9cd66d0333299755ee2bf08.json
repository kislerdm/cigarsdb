A Honduran puro, the Aladino Corojo Reserva, as it name clearly states, uses Cuban-seed Corojo tobaccos to create a full-strength stick and a classic flavor profile that consists of earth, cedar, tobacco and pepper with a floral touch. The Aladino Corojo Reserva is one premium cigar that, once smoked, will earn a permanent place in your humidor.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":96},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Katman","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
