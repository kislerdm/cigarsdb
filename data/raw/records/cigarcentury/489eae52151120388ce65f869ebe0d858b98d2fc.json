Used in respected blends across the industry, Aganorsa Leaf has plenty of street cred. Now they are putting their award-worthy tobaccos to use under their own name, and boy have they made a splash.. Casa Fernandez Aganorsa Leaf Corojo is a Nicaraguan puro that utilizes ultra-premium tobaccos that were all cultivated on Aganorsa farms in Esteli, Jalapa, and Condega. The wrapper leaf is a Corojo Sun Grown wrapper that was harvested in 2006. Beneath, a bevy of vintage long-fillers, also from Aganorsa combine for a flavorful medium-bodied experience. Upon lighting Casa Fernandez Aganorsa Leaf, you are met with heady notes of caramel, toasted wood, and chocolate."}
