Blend-wise, it uses an Ecuadorian rosado wrapper over an American binder and fillers from Honduras and Nicaragua. Like seven of the eight lines the company has introduced, it’s offered in the exact same four vitolas. And like all the company’s releases, it’s made at La Zona Cigar Factory in Estelí."}
