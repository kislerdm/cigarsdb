The original Henry Clay cigars, the first Henry Clay made outside of Cuba, is produced by Altadis U.S.A. in the Dominican Republic with fully aged Dominican binder and long-filler tobaccos, finished with a Connecticut broadleaf maduro wrapper. Although its rustic appearance will never win any beauty contests, these cigars have been a long time favorite for those who enjoy a maduro wrapped stick with intensely delicious notes of chocolate, spice, dark roast coffee, and leather.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":85},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
