While the White Series is the flagship, the Black Series is rated very highly and holds its own among beginner cigars recommendations thanks to its medium strength and body. Black Series is one of the three main lines from Cavalier, along with its sequel Black Series II, and the White Series for which the brand is best known. The Cavalier Black Series consists of several vitolas, including the extra-long. There's cream, brown sugar, and milky coffee, with floral and woody hints, along with that ever-present cinnamon spice. Look out for the marshmallow retrohales."}
