Although this boutique brand is new on the scene, their stable of refined premiums convey a level of artistry that can only be gained through experience. D’Crossier Imperium Class Vintage is medium to full-bodied and comes draped in an elegant, sun grown, vintage Costa Rican wrapper atop a blend of Ecuadorian, Dominican Republic, and Costa Rican long-fillers. Upon lighting this gorgeous premium I was met with creamy flavors including cocoa, earth, and wood. This premium blend burned perfectly and continued to dish out wave after wave of complexity and rich flavors down to the nub."}
