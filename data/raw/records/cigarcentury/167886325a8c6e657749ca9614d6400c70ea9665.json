Instead, the latest hit to come out of the Davdioff camp calls on select tobaccos grown in Yamasa, Dominican Republic – a region with a reputation for being difficult \nYamasa showcases a gorgeous, milk chocolaty wrapper leaf grown in this challenging region that took a team of scientists to perfect…and it’s evident in its seamless appearance. Also featuring a binder from San Vicente, DR and aged long-fillers from Nicaragua, Yamasa excels with hints of sweetness, leather, and rich spices. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
