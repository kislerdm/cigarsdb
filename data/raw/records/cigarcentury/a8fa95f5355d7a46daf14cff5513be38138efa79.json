Avo XO presents a solid medium-bodied profile through a golden brown Ecuador Connecticut wrapper over a pleasant assortment of Dominican long-filler tobaccos. Hints of nuts with sweet and peppery notes of dried fruit and grain deliver a creamy finish. Elegant construction and approachable flavors reveal Avoâ€™s distinct and steady satisfaction."}
