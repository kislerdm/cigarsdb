One of the reasons the tradition has gotten a bad rap is the quality of the sticks is not always up to snuff. Unscrupulous companies will take whatever scraps and floor sweepings they can find to twist together under a blue or pink band counting on harried fathers or sincere friends not knowing the difference. Alec Bradley cigars, however, always represent the highest quality so there’s nothing to fear. Containing a choice selection of Honduran and Nicaraguan longleaf filler, this mild-medium cigar is finished with a creamy and delightful Connecticut wrapper."}
