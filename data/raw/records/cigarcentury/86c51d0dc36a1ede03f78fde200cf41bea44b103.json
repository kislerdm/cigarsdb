The Turrent's have cornered the market in producing Mexican tobacco, a country of origin that has been steadily rising in popularity as of late. And Casa Turrent Serie 1901 utilizes their most premium Mexican crop, melds it with bold Nicaraguan tobaccos, and delivers the most decorated Turrent-branded release to date. The wrapper is a bit spotty (a norm with Mexican leaf), but don't let that deter you because once you spark this premium up, you'll be met with hints of sweet cedar, leather, mellow pepper, and nut.Â "}
