Both the name, CAO Bones, and the various size names reflect terms commonly found in a game of dominos. Hailing from the STG Estelí factory in Nicaragua, Bones uses a dark Connecticut broadleaf wrapper to encase a Connecticut shade binder and a filler combination of Nicaraguan tobacco, Dominican Piloto Cubano and Honduran leaf that together produce a solid burning, medium- to full-bodied profile that even the most experienced aficionado can enjoy. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
