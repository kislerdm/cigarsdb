Coming in one size only (6 x 54), this limited edition offering is a bit of a mutt in the sense that it utilizes three different countries of origin for its tobacco - a Nicaraguan wrapper from Jalapa, a Honduran binder, and a zesty mix of Dominican, Honduran and Nicaraguan fillers. Limited to 1,500 boxes of 10, don't miss your chance to try this once in a lifetime milestone.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":83}]}
