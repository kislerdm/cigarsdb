It was also an extension to the 91-rated Long live the King blend from the Caldwell Collection. After much praise it has received some additional sizes in the lineup and regular production for more to enjoy. The blend for Savages has been kept a secret, but we do know that it uses a Habano wrapper. While the Long Live The King blend was one of Caldwell’s most full-bodied releases, Savages takes it back a notch, falling in the middle of the spectrum. But the flavor is still there, in true Caldwell fashion, this cigar is incredibly rich, complex, well-balanced, smooth and enjoyable any time of day. We get notes of earth, pepper, leather, nuts and some coffee."}
