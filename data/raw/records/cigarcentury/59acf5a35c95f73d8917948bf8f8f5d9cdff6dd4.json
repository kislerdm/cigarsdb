In 2006, this limited-edition blend was released in just one size. It was an instant hit and by the 25th anniversary in 2010, five sizes were available to aficionados everywhere. The Ashton ESG’s flavor and quality has been said to parallel the renowned Fuente Opus X. This rare leaf is grown and cultivated on Château de la Fuente farm in the Dominican Republic exclusively for the Ashton Estate Sun Grown. The flawless, rich combination creates a complex, full-bodied smoke that will remain smooth from start to finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
