His partners include a restauranteur and an Air Force Veteran. Micky who worked for Davidoff and CAO in separate stints returns to the industry with the limited edition Solamente which is only made in one size at TAVICUSA in Nicaragua. The Habano wrapper from Ecuador is loaded with oils and it has a couple of significant veins. Moving into the first third the pepper subsides as a brief note of chocolate emerges before pulling back. The cigar has an oak component and a touch of leather along with a meaty quality to it. This cigar would still pair well with a nice red wine.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
