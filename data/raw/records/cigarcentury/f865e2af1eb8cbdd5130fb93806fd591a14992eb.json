The banding is consistent with other Dapper—and indeed other boutique—releases in that it is attractive and pleasing to the eye, while being almost completely unreadable. Come with sweet earthiness, almond, and a hint of Citrus come through on the palate. Nuttiness, pepper, and honey complexities show in the retrohale."}
