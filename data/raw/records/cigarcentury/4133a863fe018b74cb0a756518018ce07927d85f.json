His goal was to create a portfolio of premium cigars that are reminiscent of those forbidden gems made in Cuba. Tatuaje is recognized for producing a number of small-batch \nThe Black Label, Avion, Fausto, Havana VI, are all bold full bodied flavor bombs that have found a permanent home in thousands of well- seasoned smokers’ humidors . Along with these bolder offerings, Johnson decided to show off his tamer side with some smoother medium bodied cigars that includes the El Triunfador, and the affordable Tattoo, that was Pete’s very first Tatuaje blend. There are a few more cigars in the Tatuaje lineup that every discerning smoker needs to discover.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
