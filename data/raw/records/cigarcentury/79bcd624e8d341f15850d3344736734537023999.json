He also mixed in more than a few stories about his life as a young man in Cuba, and our conversations transported me back to a very special time when pride and devotion to craftsmanship truly meant something.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Katman","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":100},{"who":"Katman","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":98}]}
