Stepping up the cigar in terms of body and flavor, each one of these handmades booms out thick notes of black pepper, leather, espresso, and earth. Plus, each box features a 50/50 split of half round cigars and half box-pressed ones, allowing you to experience two uniquely nuanced versions of this showcase cigar.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
