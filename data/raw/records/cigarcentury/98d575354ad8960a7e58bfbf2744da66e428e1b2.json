There are so many good cigars coming out of Alan Rubin's Raices Cubanas factory in Danli, Honduras that it's hard to decide which is your favorite, and while the 'Cuban sandwich style' Spirit of Cuba is not out to win any awards, it certainly will keep your daily smoking needs well taken care of. As for the specs, what else could the wrapper be but Nicaraguan Corojo, while the binder is from Honduras. The filler is a blend of tobacco from both of those countries, selected to emphasize the best traits of each."}
