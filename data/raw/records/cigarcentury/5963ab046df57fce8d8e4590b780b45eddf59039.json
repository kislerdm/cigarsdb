Crafted with the utmost in care and detail, 'VR' is produced in CAO’s esteemed “CAO Fabrica de Tabacos” factory in Danli, Honduras. 'The 'VR' cigar employs well-aged Nicaraguan and Mexican long-fillers which yield a robust and slightly spicy profile, while its oily Brazilian Maduro Arapiraca wrapper adds balance and a hefty dose of rich-sweet flavor. Off the bat you’re greeted with a burst of peppery goodness that smooths out almost immediately as the Brazilian wrapper throws its sweet, leathery character into the mix."}
