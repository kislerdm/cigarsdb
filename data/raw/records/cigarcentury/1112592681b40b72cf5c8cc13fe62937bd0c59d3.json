The Pappy Van Winkle Barrel Fermented cigar is a 100% long-filler, premium cigar made totally by hand in very small batches at Drew Estate in Estelí, Nicaragua. This historic cigar features a “barrel fermented” “tapa negra”-style wrapper over a Mexican San Andres base wrapper, as well as aged Nicaraguan Filler tobaccos, personally selected by me. It is the perfect choice for pairing with any of the Van Winkle bourbon and rye products.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
