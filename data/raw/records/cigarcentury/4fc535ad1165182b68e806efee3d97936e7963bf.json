At the start, you’ll find a classic full-bodied profile loaded with notes of coffee and woods. But let this baby burn, and soon earth, fruit, and a light, spicy finish will join the mix. It’d be tough to pick a favorite cigar from Archetype, but Strange Passage is, without a doubt, their most complex. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":81},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":71}]}
