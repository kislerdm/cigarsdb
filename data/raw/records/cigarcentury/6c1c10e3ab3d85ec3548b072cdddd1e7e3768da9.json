The statue is carved out of marble and features Mary wearing a veil. It’s a pretty incredible piece of art that matches the strength of marble with delicately carved features. And that’s exactly how we feel about the Dama Valada. This blend combines the full throttle strength of a Nicaraguan Rosado Oscura Luz wrapper leaf with delicate flavor notes of espresso, leather, dark chocolate, and a vanilla sweetness from the wrapper leaf."}
