Asylum 13 offers bold blends with abundant flavor and craftsmanship that is nothing short of perfection - and the newest creation will blow your mind. Medulla Oblongata is composed of Honduran wrapper, binder, and filler - making this little puro a medium to full-bodied taste sensation with notes of leather, earth, espresso, and spice. What makes this cigar so unique is how itâ€™s packaged. Each box comes with a 50/50 split where half of the cigars are Medulla (round parejos) and half are Oblongata (box-pressed cigars)."}
