Though he left the company in May of this year he says he has retained his equity as a partner in Caldwell Cigar Co. As part of the Wildfire Cigar Co. introductory portfolio the company released two blends – The Single (limited production) and The Revivalist (full production). I picked up two each these at my local Brick and Mortar, Executive Cigar Shop and Lounge, in Melbourne, FL. Today I offer a review of The Revivalist Toro. It offered a complex array of pre-light flavors including pepper, smoke, malt, natural sweetness. There is a lot going on in the cold draw, even a hint of raisin. This is one I suggest cold puffing more than normal to truly appreciate the flavors."}
