Symbolizing one of the oldest stories written into existence based on the historical records of Assyrian King Gilgamesh, this collection provides a unique tasting experience while focusing on the strength, flavor, aroma, and combustion of the cigar. Offering both medium bodied and full bodied cigars, these cigars’ burns last for a long period of time, while possessing a milder light-up than the traditional El Septimo Cigar, resulting in a gradual pace with the perfect balance between thickness and length."}
