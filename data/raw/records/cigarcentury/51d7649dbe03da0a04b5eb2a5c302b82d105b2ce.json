While out to dinner one night, former musician Avo Uvezian became irate over the price he had to pay for a Cuban cigar. He decided to take matters into his own hands and, along with famed cigar-craftsman Hendrik Kelner, created an original line made from only the finest tobacco. The AVO Classic cigar is a beautifully constructed piece from the very finest premium leaves, including a silky Connecticut shade wrapper and Dominican long-filler leaves. The result is a creamy, smooth taste and wonderful aroma. "}
