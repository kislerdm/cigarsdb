Along with a new box-pressed shape, the cigars also have a slightly tweaked blend. The rare and stunning Negrito Mejorado maduro wrapper atop a Dominican binder has remained the same, but whereas the originally offering was a Dominican puro, Escape Plan Drybeggar features a multi-nation blend of long filler tobacco from the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Peru. The cigars are medium-to-full bodied, and laced with smooth, complex flavors of bittersweet chocolate, leather, and espresso , backed by a rich tobacco sweetness that lingers on the palate."}
