Just like the horse Alcazar, these cigars were a hit. Unfortunately even with its wide-spread popularity the Great Depression ultimately meant the end for the Alcazar brand.Realizing the enormous potential of this lost brand, J.C. Newman offered to buy the rights to Alcazar and added the cigar to his company portfolio. J.C. Newman Cigar Companyâ€™s long history dates back more than a century to 1895, when Julius Caeser Newman rolled his first cigars in the family barn in Cleveland, Ohio. It is clear J.C. had an eye for great cigars because this historic brand is still available from J.C. Newman Cigar Company today.Now a handmade Nicaraguan cigar and packaged in an affordable bundle, Alcazar Maduros continue to please the palate of cigar-lovers across the country."}
