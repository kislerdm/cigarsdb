Brown’s mindset was to keep his blends exciting but his portfolio small. Within each line only a few sizes are made. \nMemento Mori translates into You Will Die, and is supposed to encourage a viewpoint to live your life today because tomorrow isn't promised. To that end, James Brown says that Memento Mori is the quintessential Black Label cigar that exhibits everything he loves about his brand: pristine wrapper leaf, immaculate packaging, perfectly balanced blend, and full-bodied flavors that are dense and chewy."}
