First introduced in 2016, this full-bodied robusto grande features a gorgeous Nicaraguan Pelo de Oro wrapper, a difficult specimen to grow due to its fragile nature and obstacles in fermenting, but one that delivers a taste like no other. Along with that you'll find a premium Nicaraguan binder and more Pelo de Oro filler completing the package, making this puro another bonafide hit for the master of Nicaraguan tobacco.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Katman","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
