For this blend, company owner and industry guru Steve Saka takes the gloves off. Story goes, in the early 2000s, Saka was given an incredibly strong cigar by Estello Padrón; when asked if he truly smokes such a strong \nTodos Las Dias is the strongest cigar to date from Dunbarton, using a high-priming, Nicaraguan puro blend that showcases Jalapa and Estelíano tobaccos in the filler, a Nicaraguan binder, and a Cuban-seed, Nicaraguan wrapper. This blend has been specially chosen to highlight the fiery, bold qualities of Nicaragua’s intense, volcanic soil. And Steve has specifically blended TLD to begin on the mellow side—slowly ramping up to the Nicaraguan powerhouse experience that diehard, experienced smokers crave! This is the complete reversal from the usual blending style of starting with a bang before mellowing in the later portions of the smoke."}
