To be their true selves and not take themselves too seriously is the point of Madcap and it’s what they hope people get out of this cigar. They believe it’s everything you look for when you hunt for that unique Honduran savory flavor with the cocoa \u0026 coffee contrast from the San Andres coating. You will find MadCap to be complex, with a dense body, yet lightly nuanced by a few flavors that don’t antagonize the main nuts, salted caramel, cocoa, and some herbs \u0026 spices."}
