It wasn't long before he realized that the soil and climate of that region would be perfect for growing premium tobacco. Since then, the Turrent family has been providing the industry with the best Mexican premium tobacco leaf (known as San Andres or San Andres maduro) and manufacturing some of the most globally popular, not to mention critically acclaimed, Mexican cigars around. Complex and flavorful on the mild side, A. Turrent Classico stands out with its fine Habano wrapper grown in the legendary San Andres Valley, along with a Criollo binder.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2005","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
