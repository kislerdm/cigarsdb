The Signature Selection filler is composed of medio tiempo leaves from Corojo and Criollo ‘98 tobaccos. These rare leaves grow at the top of the plant and receive more sunlight than any other part of the plant. Cigars made of medio tiempo leaves are known for being rich in flavor and strength. This rare filler is then covered by a Corojo binder, which is then surrounded by a Corojo maduro wrapper. The Aganorsa Leaf Signature Selection Maduro’s strength is matched by complex notes of earth, cedar, and butter.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":94}]}
