This region has the perfect soil and a similar climate to Cuba’s renowned Vuelta Abajo region. The company started over 25 years ago and now employs more than 3,300 people and will produce more than 15 million cigars this year, including the La Fontana and Camacho brands. The tasty corona you’ll sample this month is handmade in Honduras from Honduran long fill, Mexican binder tobaccos and a Honduran wrapper. Look for a very mild smoke with a smooth taste and hints of coffee flavors. Look for excellent construction and an effortless draw. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2001","ratingOutOf100":83}]}
