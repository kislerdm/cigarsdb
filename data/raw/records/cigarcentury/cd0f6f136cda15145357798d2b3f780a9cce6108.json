The petite 4.25 x 32 size lends itself well to a delicious 30-minute smoke, and the mellow to medium strength flavors of cocoa, coffee and just a hint of pepper is perfect to pair with a nice after dinner dessert liquor. The production of Ashton Esquire Cigars will be held in the Dominican Republic and in the full hand. The moderate Domingos show on the palate creamy, nutty flavor and a medium body. The burn is very even and perfectly the migratory behavior."}
