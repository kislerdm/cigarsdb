Varying from the original Asylum 13, a Nicaraguan Puro, the Corojo calls Honduras home, having grown in Eiroa’s family farm in Honduras. Skillfully formed Asylum's Tabacos Rancho Jamastran factory in Honduras, featuring some incredibly well-aged Honduran tobaccos, and featuring a flawlessly-decadent chocolate-brown Corojo wrapper, the Asylum 13 Corojo is a Honduran Puro that produces robust flavors of earth, espresso, and cedar with a silky sweet finish and a hint of citrus. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
