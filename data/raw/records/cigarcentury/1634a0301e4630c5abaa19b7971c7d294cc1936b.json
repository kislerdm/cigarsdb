Gigantes features a dark chocolate-colored, oily Nicaraguan Habano wrapper leaf cultivated in 2007. Underneath, this concoction boasts a Brazilian Mata Fina binder aged for a minimum of 6 years which hugs vintage Nicaraguan and Dominican long-fillers also with at least 6 years of aged behind them. Medium to full-bodied, bold notes of black pepper, licorice, and a lingering sweet spice are all noticeable with a hint of leather sneaking in on the back of the palate.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
