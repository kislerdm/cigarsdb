When Alejandro Martinez-Cuenca acquired it in 1994, the brand was a faded jewel, still struggling to recover from a war that had left the factory where it's made that was burned to the ground. Martinez Cuenca brought fresh ideas to the company, rehired many of its old rollers and blenders, and eventually released Joya de Nicaragua Antaño 1970, a full-bodied cigar that recaptured the taste of the brand's glory days. Since then, the brand has spawned many lines, including milder cigars.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
