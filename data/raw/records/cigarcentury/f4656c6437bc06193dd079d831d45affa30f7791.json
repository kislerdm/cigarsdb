He brought to Tampa, Florida its renaissance of the cigar industry by providing you the finest cigars handmade by greatest artisans who truly love the craft. He was born in 1978 to a really poor family in the outskirts \nWhenever he asked someone the first word out of their mouths was Arturo Fuente or JC Newman.  However, Newman stopped producing hand made cigars in the 50s and switched to machine made. Arturo Fuentes left Tampa in late 70s and moved to Nicaragua. It didn’t work out in Nicaragua and they moved to the Dominican Republic. So there was no hand made brand in Tampa, Florida. That is when he became determined to start a brand to put Tampa back on the map as the premier place for the finest hand-made cigars and he did. After several failures, setbacks effort, patience and faith in God, he finally could settle down in this Dreamed Corner at Ybor City, Tampa. "}
