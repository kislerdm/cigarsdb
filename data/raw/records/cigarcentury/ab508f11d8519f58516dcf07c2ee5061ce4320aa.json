Esteban Dislas is the architect behind the highly sought after CroMagnon, Intemperance and Aquiatane brands, while Island Jim is responsible for the Leaf by Oscar cigars that proved to be one of the most popular hits in the past few years. The cigar is rolled in just one 6 x 52 Toro size with aged Nicaraguan binder and long fillers, covered by a stunning reddish-brown Ecuador Habano wrapper. You can expect a medium to full bodied smoke that’s oozing with warm and inviting flavors of cocoa, coffee, milk chocolate, and subtle hints of spice. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
