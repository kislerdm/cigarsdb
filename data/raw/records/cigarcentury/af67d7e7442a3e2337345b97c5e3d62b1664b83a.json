The rolling journey starts with fully aged filler tobaccos then each cigar is covered by a dual binder consisting of top-quality Jalapa and Estelí leaves, and finished with a stunning reddish-brown Habano Rosado wrapper. Solidly packed, slow burning, and flawlessly rolled, Cabañas™ cigars provide a medium to full bodied smoke that produces rich complex flavors of coffee, molasses, roasted peanuts, and a touch of spice. "}
