The secret behind this exquisite cigar is the dark, oily wrapper. Rolled with a super-rich, Ecuadorian-grown El Bajo sungrown leaf from the Oliva family’s farm, this cigar is almost as enjoyable to look at as it is to burn. A bold, full-flavored cigar that’s chock full of robust, satisfying flavors and luxuriously smooth from start to finish. A wonderful (but expensive) top-shelf premium.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2008","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
