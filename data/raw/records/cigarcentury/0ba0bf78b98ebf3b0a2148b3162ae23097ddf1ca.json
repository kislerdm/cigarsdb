The new PCA Exclusive is a Box Pressed Perfecto based on the eponymous 7-20-4 blend. Last year, this line moved production to the J. Fuego factory and received an updated blend. The new perfecto measures 6 x 54 and is the first box-pressed offering by 7-20-4. Kendall says this cigar will be “made to order” based on the amount of orders that took place at the PCA Trade Show."}
