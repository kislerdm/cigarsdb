Using a combination of authentic Cuban-seeds and the ideal location, the Jamastran Valley of Honduras, Camacho. Thatâ€™s Camacho Corojo in a nutshell, an everyday treasure that was crafted with the true cigar aficionado in mind. Made with a super high-grade, fifth priming Corojo wrapper leaf, this fine specimen aims to please and succeeds with ease. Beneath the covers, an authentic Corojo binder and bevy of three primings of Corojo long-fillers complete the mix. Smooth, classic, well-aged, and well-constructed.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Daily","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
