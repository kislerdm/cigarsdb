This four vitola line is a medium-full bodied experience that will have creamy notes of coca, graham cracker, natural sweetness, and a peppery finish dancing across your palate from start to finish. Created with the same precise construction as all their other lines, this cigar will leave no doubt in your mind that it was well worth the wait. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
