Havana Q by Quorum takes the immensely popular Quorum Nicaraguan binder and filler blend and lovingly encloses it inside of an Ecuadorian Habano Havana-seed wrapper creating a medium-bodied experience for just pennies on the dollar. Filled with traditional Cuban tasting notes, your senses will be treated to bread, pepper, espresso, leather, earthiness, cocoa, cedar, and spice from the first draw. Produced in Nicaragua under JC Newman's highest construction standards."}
