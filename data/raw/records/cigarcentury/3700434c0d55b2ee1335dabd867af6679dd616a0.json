This blend really has it all, from an intriguing, invigorating flavor profile to a mix of well-chosen tobacco leaves. Plus, the intensity: though it weighs in just above a medium-body, the flavor is incredibyl rich, with a long and unique finish you won't soon forget. Topped with a choice Ecuadorian Habano wrapper leaf, a Brazilian binder, and a blend of long fillers from Honduras and the Dominican, Camacho Ecuador is the total package. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":83},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
