Available only as a 7x48 Churchill vitola, these delectably good smokes are made with masterfully aged Nicaraguan long fillers bunched inside a hearty Connecticut Broadleaf binder all dressed in a top-shelf Ecuadorian Corojo 99 wrapper. Like much of the other top-rated Crowned Heads blends that I enjoy, Mother Church is crafted by hand at Tabacalera Pichardo in Nicaragua. Once I put a flame to the foot of Mother Church, my palate is greeted with a bold and rich medium-full bodied smoke loaded with complex notes of roasted nuts, spice, cocoa, charred hickory, and a delectable tobacco sweetness.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
