They made him up. His name means Rico – ‘rich’ Barato – ‘cheap’. These are our economy cigar brand, and they have a very special place in their creators hearts. There was a long time when co-owner Tim Swanson could only afford sticks like these. Each stick is a mix of long filler with some short filler sprinkled in, making this a Cuban Sandwich. The drawback with these affordable cigars is that they burn a little faster, and have a pretty simple flavor profile. But they feel that these Connecticut sticks offer incredible consistency, construction, and flavor. This wallet-friendly stick that features a natural Cameroon wrapper placed over a Nicaraguan binder and long and short-filler leaves from Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. This Cuban sandwich is available in three wrappers: Cameroon, Connecticut, and Maduro."}
