Kaizad Hansotia encountered a Portuguese man rolling and selling cigars under the attention-grabbing name and was so intrigued that he decided to purchase his inventory and use the cigars as gifts for customers of his family's timepiece business. After surprising success and feedback, Hansotia saw the potential in producing high-end cigars and sought out the assistance of Charlie Torano to help kick-start his new endeavor. Since then, Gurkha has become prolific in making complex and savory blends, all of which you can bet come packaged in ornate, eye-catching presentations."}
