It’s like walking out of Costco with five shopping carts full of goodies and only dropping forty bones. Well now the ante has been upped with their newest release, Uncut. This beaut, blended by the masterful hands of A.J. Fernandez is undiluted, unapologetic, and unmatched in its flavor, consistency, and its unbelievable price point. To create Uncut, A.J. selected a robust blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers and finished it with a medium-brown Pennsylvania Broadleaf natural wrapper to deliver a rich, hearty blend loaded with notes of chocolate, nuts, black pepper, and cedar. "}
