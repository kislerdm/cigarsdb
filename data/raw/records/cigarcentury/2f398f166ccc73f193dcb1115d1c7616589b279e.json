This medium-bodied version is accomplished with the utilization of an all-Jalapa filler blend delivering a balanced level of smoothness and flavor without the intense body and strength of the regular Cain. Construction is spot-on and is headlined by an oily Nicaraguan wrapper that is not only visually appealing, but also highly complex with notes ranging from green pepper to a creamy, honey-like sweetness.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
