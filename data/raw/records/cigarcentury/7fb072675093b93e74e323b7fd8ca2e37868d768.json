The medium to full-bodied profile with powerful notes of cocoa, coffee, earth, wood, and pepper breaks all boundaries of flavor and brings an incredibly enjoyable chaos to the palate. In a world where everyday is filled with rules and regulations.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
