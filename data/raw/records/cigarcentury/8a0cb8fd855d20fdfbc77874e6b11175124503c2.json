In this case, the honor of Caldwell’s first exclusive goes to Casa de Montecristo, one of the largest chains of high end cigar lounges in the USA. The Casa by Caldwell is, like other Caldwell cigars, wonderfully presented. The outer Sand Andres wrapper is thick and leathery, with a dark, inviting complexion. Off of the foot there are strong scents of dust, cedar, black pepper, and savory meats. The cold draw on the other hand is subdued, with some granola and dark chocolate. "}
