Wrapped in a toothy Mexican San Andres leaf, Rock-A-Feller Maduro Red cigar  boasts a rich and creamy experience. The Ecuadorian binder and multinational Nicaraguan and PA Broadleaf fillers add a body to the cigar that make you want to smoke another.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
