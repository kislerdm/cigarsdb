Fast forward to this April, the company announced tha it would be distribuited in the U.S. by Crowned Heads. That partnership \nPelo de Oro is a rarely used tobacco because its susceptibility to blue mold makes it difficult to grow, but it produces a very savory flavor. This is a well-balanced cigar that exudes pleasant floral notes with hints of citrus, and a smooth draw. The Luciano The Dreamer is hand crafted at the Tabacalera Pichardo in Nicaragua."}
