Their parents were immigrants from the Canary Islands. These cousins owned a modest cigar factory near Havana and inherited two humble tobacco plantations from their parents. In those days, premium \nThe Lord Byron line sold like crazy. So much so that after a few years, the cousins moved to a larger factory, this time in Havana. The brand would remain a success for generations. But, as the story so often goes, the party came to an end or at least hit a temporary bump in the road. Ricardo Alfonzo, one of the cousin’s grandson, was running the company when a series of financial hardships came knocking, and he was forced to sell the Lord Byron brand. It would take 90 years for Nelson Alfonso, great-grandson of Ricardo Alfonzo, to revive the brand as Byron Cigars through his company."}
