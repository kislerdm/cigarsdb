While out to dinner one night, former musician Avo Uvezian became irate over the price he had to pay for a Cuban cigar. He decided to take matters into his own hands and, along with famed cigar-craftsman Hendrik Kelner, created an original line made from only the finest tobacco. The AVO Classic cigar is a beautifully constructed piece from the very finest premium leaves, including a silky Connecticut shade wrapper and Dominican long-filler leaves. The result is a creamy, smooth taste and wonderful aroma. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
