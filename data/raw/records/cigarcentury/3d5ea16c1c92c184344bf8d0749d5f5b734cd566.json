Introducing the Enclave Broadleaf, Fernandez's first cigar to use a broadleaf maduro wrapper. While the first version focused on flavor versus strength, this tasty Nicaraguan offering chooses to provide plenty of both, as its dark and oily broadleaf wrapper gives the blend a booster shot into full-bodied territory. Black pepper and leather dominate the experience, and notes of cedar balance out what is sure to be another home run for AJ Fernandez's ever-growing presence in the premium cigar industry.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
