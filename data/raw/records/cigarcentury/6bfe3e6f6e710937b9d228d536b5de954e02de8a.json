This “everyman smoke” concept was conceived by brand ambassador and master blender Rick Rodriguez who was inspired by the many cigars he enjoyed with friends in his garage. Unlike most CAO cigars that are fabricated in Central America, Session cigars are made in the Dominican Republic in collaboration with Yuri Guillen, factory manager of General Cigar Dominicana. Adding to its intrigue, Session cigars are the first CAO blend to be made in the D.R. in over 10 years! To create these very special cigars, Rick and Yuri chose to use a gorgeous, dark, oily, Connecticut broadleaf wrapper, a sturdy Dominican binder, and select filler tobaccos from Nicaragua and Dominican Republic that have been aged to perfection. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":83},{"who":"Katman","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":60}]}
