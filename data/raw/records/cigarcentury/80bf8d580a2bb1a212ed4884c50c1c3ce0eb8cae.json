The tobaccos used are exquisite, making each cigar within the line a homerun from start to finish. Taken from the tobacco plant's highest primings, the Ecuadorian sun grown wrapper offers a rich, reddish hue and spicy, chewy flavor. The 4-5 year old Dominican long-fillers are masterfully blended to promote a smooth, but eventful flavor that's hearty and robust.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"202","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
