Back then, most people didn’t know who AJ was, and Diesel’s Unholy Cocktail had just a small, cult following. Jump ahead to today, and Diesel is one of the fastest-moving brands on our shelves, with AJ easily becoming \n100% full-bodied, 100% full-flavored, and 100% Diesel. D.10th will be most familiar to those who love AJ’s leaf. For this commemorative release, A.J.’s inspected and selected the finest Ecuadorian Habano Oscuro wrapper to top a blend that’s as delicious as it is powerful. Overflowing with rich, hearty notes of dark chocolate, earth, and roasted coffee and brought together by a mouthwatering, spicy-sweet finish","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
