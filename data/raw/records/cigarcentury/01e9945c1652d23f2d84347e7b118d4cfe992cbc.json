The dynamic duo took over two years to craft the beauty before you today, and the results were well worth the wait. A truly rare blend, Comador plays host to a bevy of uber-refined tobaccos. Hand-selected long-fillers from the most fertile regions of Central America and the Caribean Basin intertwine, held snuggly in place by a vintage Connecticut Broadleaf binder. A gorgeous 4-year aged, Connecticut wrapper graces the top of Comador, carefully chosen from Cohiba’s proprietary farms in the pristine Connecticut River Valley.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Katman","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":12},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
