Dating back to his head of Camacho days, Eiroa has a fond love for premium Honduran tobacco, so it should come as no surprise that this three vitola line are Honduran puro’s. Asylum 9 offers a savory array of flavors that includes earth, coffee, leather, toast and spice, all delivered in a smooth, slow burning medium bodied fashion."}
