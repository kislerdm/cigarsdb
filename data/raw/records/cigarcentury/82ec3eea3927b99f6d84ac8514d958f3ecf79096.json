Originally crafted by the Quesada family for 45 years, the Garcia family took over the brand in December 2019 and subsequently released its Corojo '99-wrapped rework less than a year later. \nThe Classic line is wrapped in leaf from Connecticut and comes in both a natural and maduro version in a host of sizes. In 1993, the Fonseca Vintage Collection was added, followed by the more robust Cubano Exclusivo in 2006. Then, in 2016, Quesada added the Fonseca Nicaragua, which was the first Fonseca to be rolled in Nicaragua and also to use only Nicaraguan tobaccos.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
