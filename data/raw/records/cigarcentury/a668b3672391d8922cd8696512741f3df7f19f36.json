Delivered inside a box adorned with the influential image, these cigars are the strongest of all of the company's offerings. Hand-made at La Zona factory in Esteli, Nacagua, Venganza cigars are comprised of local Nicaraguan binder and filler cloacked by an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper. This powerful tobacco combination comes out of the gate with full body and full flavor with notes of pepper and spice. After awaking the palate, a smooth creaminess loaded with notes of cedar, leather, espresso, and a natural sweetness take over to round out the experience. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
