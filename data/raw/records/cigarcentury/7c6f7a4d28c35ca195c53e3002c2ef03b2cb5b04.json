The LX2 is packed inside a smooth, oily Nicaraguan sun-grown wrapper selected for its great strength and flavors you will find a truly unusual filler blend.  Composed of three, yes three, different ligero leaves from CAO’s Pueblo Neuvo farm in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic’s best growing region, the LX2 cigar boasts a super rich, strong smoke. The CAO LX2 is loaded with tantalizing aromas of cocoa, wood, spice, leather and dried fruit and an amazing finish. "}
