These gems are offered in eight different popular sizes and are crafted with finely aged Nicaraguan long filler and binder tobaccos draped in a top-shelf Nicaraguan wrapper with either a rosado or maduro hue. The Curivari Seleccion Privada is an all Nicaraguan puro with the perfect balance of strength and flavor. These medium-bodied smokes contain notes of wood with a touch of vanilla and sweetness on the finish."}
