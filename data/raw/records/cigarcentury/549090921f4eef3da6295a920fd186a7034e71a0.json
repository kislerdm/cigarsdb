There is a slight—and I do mean slight—indeterminate sweetness and some white pepper on the retrohale that both become a bit more evident as the first third burns down, but neither are strong enough at this point to really affect the profile in any significant way. Construction-wise, both the burn and draw are excellent so far and smoke production is above normal. The strength in the blend is noticeable, but not aggressive, and ends the first third noticeably short of the medium mark."}
