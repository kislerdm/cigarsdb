Straight Jacket is an all-Nicaraguan puro with a smooth, chocolate-y brown wrapper. But even more impressive than the wrapper is this band. Featuring an edgy, illustrated straight jacket, it really sets the tone for the cigar. A dense, intensely flavored powerhouse that's 100% consistent from start to finish. Notes of earth, pepper, cocoa, and coffee gradually reveal themselves.Â "}
