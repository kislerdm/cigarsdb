This process produces an extremely unique cigar with savory flavor profiles and hypnotizing aromas. ACID Opulence 3 takes things up a notch, thanks to a beautiful, aged San Andres maduro wrapper thatâ€™s rich, chewy, and loaded with natural oils. Beneath this leaf, a complex mixture of vintage, Cuban-seed long-fillers from Nicaragua was blended. After a painstaking infusion process, the Opulence 3 delivers a delicious array of rich tobacco flavors with a sweet, aromatic influence."}
