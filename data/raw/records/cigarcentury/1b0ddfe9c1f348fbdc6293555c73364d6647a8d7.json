That’s the night, I saw for myself, by flashlight, a crop that was beyond belief. Tobaccos I knew we would find a special project for. Under the stars, we cracked open a bottle of very special whisky and proposed a toast to our future\" said Alan Rubin. Magic Toast was born that evening. Along with a ritual. Toast the end of this cigar. Celebrate its beginning. And enjoy the magic. A medium-bodied profile of cocoa, wood, and cinnamon is drawn from a recipe of Nicaraguan and Honduran long-fillers beneath an oily, ultra-dark-brown Honduran wrapper leaf. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
