Now, for the first time, we are using the Solera system by combining different vintages of tobacco at different stages of the aging process to obtain a fuller flavor and more complex cigar. This Dominican puro features a Corojo wrapper. Dominican Corojo wrapper, Dominican Habano binder, and Dominican long-filler leaves. The profile — rewardingly complex. A warm, rich cedar core is greeted by notes of earth, milk chocolate, and coffee. Further into the blend, a sweet and fruity note enters the mix that stays around ‘til the end."}
