This cigar is a eco friendly cigar. By eco we mean economy friendly. This stick wont hurt your wallet. This box pressed beauty is wrapped in a dark Nicaraguan leaf. Bound with Jalapa tobacco from the famous Jalapa Valley, Nicaragua. The filler is a complex assortment of tobaccos; Esteli-Finca Soledad Ligero, Condega Ligero, and Viso Ometepe. This extremely well-made cigar delivers a spicy and chocolate character buttressed by an earthy, nutty core and a hint of caramel before the herbal finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
