Chogui Dos77 are Dominican puros employing Havana-seed wrappers, Criollo ‘98 binders and a filler blend of “Habano 2020” and Corojo leaves. It is medium bodied and complex. Victor Nicolás founded Chogüí in 2014 in the Dominican Republic and his cigars were sold only there during its first year but are now available in the US for the first time. The Chogui cigars are made at an unnamed, small factory in Tamboril, Dominican Republic.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
