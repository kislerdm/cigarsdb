The Habano is a Nicaraguan puro with corojo 99 and criollo 98 fillers.These cigars were previously branded under the Casa Fernández AGANORSA Connecticut and Habano lines, but AGANORSA Leaf decided to completely rebrand the cigars as part of its transition away from the Casa Fernandez name. The new name is inspired by Paul Palmer, president of AGANORSA Leaf, and his use of the term validate to describe the process by which he smokes cigars to approve of their quality. "}
