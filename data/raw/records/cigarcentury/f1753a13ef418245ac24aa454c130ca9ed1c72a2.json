Roberto P. Duran, not the boxer, can trace his roots in the cigar world back to Cuba in the late 1920’s, and after many years in the industry decided to bring the true Cuban cigar experience to the United States. Featuring two distinct blends, the Classic and the more full-bodied F8, Neya (named after the mother of one of the master blenders at Duran Cigars) aims to provide a traditional flavor profile true to the Cuban heritageNeya Classic features a blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers tucked underneath a gorgeous, smooth Ecuadoran Habano wrapper. This medium to full-bodied cigar will tantalize you with abundant flavors of pepper, nuts, \u0026 fruit alongside pleasing hints of natural tobacco. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
