They’ve taken their vintage Cuban leaf and aged it. Then went back and aged it a bit more until its Jedi ways corrupted it and turned it dark so that its flavors produced earthy and rich tones, peppered with light spices, wood and sweet satisfaction. The emperor would be pleased with this cigar. It commands respect. The Camacho Corojo Maduro utilizes a fifth priming authentic Corojo leaf, which slumbers for a minimum of 18 months before being awakened."}
