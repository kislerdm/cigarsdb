This blend boldly showcases a four country long-filler mix of Dominican, Nicaraguan, Italian, and, you guessed it, American tobaccos. Expect a rich, chewy profile, loaded with cream and oaky nuances. The finish is short and sweet, but don’t be fooled — CAO America is a robust, medium to full-bodied beast."}
