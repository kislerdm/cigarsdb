The Asylum Dragon’s Milk is a limited production cigar that is aged in those same barrels in which the beer had been aging. The end result is a cigar that absorbs flavors from those same bourbon barrels. While barrel aging is not something new to tobacco, the connection between cigar to beer to bourbon makes this a unique cigar.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Katman","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":77},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":82}]}
