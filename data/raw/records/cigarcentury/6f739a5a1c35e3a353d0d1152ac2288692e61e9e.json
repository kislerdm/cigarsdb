Casa Cuevas is a family owned business that first started in the tobacco industry four generations ago in the Pinar Del Rio valley of Cuba where they cultivated tobacco. Casa Cuevas Connecticut is an exquisite blend of Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper, Nicaraguan binder and Dominican and Nicaraguan filler. This mild to medium blend with subtle spice is made in Tabacalera Las Lavas in Santiago, Dominican Republic.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
