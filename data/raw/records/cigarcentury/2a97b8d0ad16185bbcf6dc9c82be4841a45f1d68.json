Umbagog is the name of one of the most pristine wilderness lakes in all of the United States. It is located on the border between Co√∂s County, New Hampshire, and Oxford County, Maine. The origin of the word is from the Abenaki Indians \nThe cigar is robust and durable, designed to endure the rigors of outside activity with its thick broadleaf wrapper and easy burning blend. This is a cigar that doesn't pretend to be special or seek to elicit the \"oohs and aahs\" of the cigar snobs. Earthy with coffee notes and a nice punch of spice. A robust, durable cigar that is perfect for any environment.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Katman","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
