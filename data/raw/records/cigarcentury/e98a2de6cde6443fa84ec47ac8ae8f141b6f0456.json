Made with a super high-grade, fifth priming Corojo wrapper leaf, this fine specimen aims to please and succeeds with ease.

Smooth, classic, well-aged, and well-constructed.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2001","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2001","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
