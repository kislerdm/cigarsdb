It also has an unusual shape that starts with a round cap, and a tapered body that ends in a square box-pressed foot. The Veritas Cigar Co. was established in 2011. Veritas is Latin for “Truth without fear,” which is the motto from the high school attended by Chris Weber, the company’s Chairman.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
