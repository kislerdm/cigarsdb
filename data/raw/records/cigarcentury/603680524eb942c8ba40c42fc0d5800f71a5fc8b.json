Michael, a big fan of Cuban cigars, found himself in the cigar business by accident after a business trip to the Dominican Republic. Cusano achieved \nThe Cusano 18 breaks from the traditional wrapper-binder-filler configuration by using two wrapper leaves and filler instead. The Cusano 18's all-Dominican filler is bound and wrapped with two light brown US Connecticut shade wrappers. Another curiosity about this cigar: the Dominican Gold tobacco in the filler has been aged for 18 years.Â Today they have a large portfolio of wallet friendly blends."}
