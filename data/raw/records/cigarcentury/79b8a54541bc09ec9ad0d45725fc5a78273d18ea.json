Classic creaminess in the perfectly aged Connecticut wrapper meets notes of hay and spice with traces of pine and citrus. Inside this mellow to medium-bodied cigar lies Cuban seed Piloto Cubano leaves where one lucky leaf in each is infused with premium French Absinthe. Botanical subtleties will greet your palate from the 15 different herbs used in the blend. Absinthe Infused Connecticut – a unique cigar well worth trying."}
