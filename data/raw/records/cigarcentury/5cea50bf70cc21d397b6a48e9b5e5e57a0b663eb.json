A hint of citrus blesses the palate while woody notes of vanilla, nuts, and leather layer the taste buds with a mix of sweet and spicy flavor. A creamy and easygoing finish characterizes an old-school Alec Bradley blend in a collection of thick and popular shapes. Save big on a classic from Alec Bradley that’s been around more than decade.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
