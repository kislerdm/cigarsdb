With each new release, a step up in quality, boldness, and flavor than the years prior. The Liberty Series has stood since its inception as one of the most highly sought-after cigars in the world. Camacho chose to create a complex and bold blend that delivers evolving flavors while maintaining consistent enjoyment. A blend that they say represents the Americana characteristics and ideals. Utilizing an Ecuadorian wrapper over a Nicaraguan binder and fillers from the Dominican Republic and Honduras, the medium to full-bodied profile will explode across your palate with notes of spice, leather, cocoa, espresso, and cedar. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
