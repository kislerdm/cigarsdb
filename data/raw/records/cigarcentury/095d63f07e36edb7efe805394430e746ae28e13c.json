Lush and fertile botanical melodies ooze from the infused tobaccos. A melodic tone of floral, herbs, and botanic notes are found while effervescent tones of tea are woven throughout.Â The ACID Holistic line is ringed in shimmering gold, a worthy tribute to all that is refined and elegant in life. Every Atom Maduro, Earthiness, and Cold Infusion Tea is a carefully measured, distinct blend of the finest cigar tobaccos touched with the softest kiss of Drew Estate's most secret herbal infusions. These are the ACID cigars of choice for the epicurean palate and soul."}
