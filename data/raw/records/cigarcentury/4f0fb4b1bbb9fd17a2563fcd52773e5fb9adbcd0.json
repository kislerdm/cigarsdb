This is rich and bold without being overly spiced nor overly earthy, ust elegantly flavorful. Just the right amount of sweetness stays though its smooth, long finish. The gorgeous Habano wrapper has a magnificent oily sheen holding all of the lovely flavors you might expect from this beautiful smoke from Nicaragua. It's a collaboration of La Corona Cigars, S.A. along with Hirochi Robaina, the grandson of world-renowned tobacconist, Alejandro Robaina. This ingenious cigar needs just two initials for its name - fitting in with its straight-forward boldness and you'll soon understand that it needs no elaborate fanfare, as it quickly rises to the top completely by its own merits."}
