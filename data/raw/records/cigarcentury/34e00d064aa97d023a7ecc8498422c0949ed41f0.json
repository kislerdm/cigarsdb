Blended by Christian Eiroa of CLE Cigars at the Aladino factory in Honduras. CBT Maduro makes use of 100% maduro leaves – the wrapper, binder, and filler are all maduro leaves harvested from only the plant’s top primings. An extremely difficult-to-blend combination, but Eiroa nailed it…again. CBT Maduro is smooth and ultra-rich with hearty, charred notes of wood, pepper, espresso, dark chocolate, and a long, bold, and meaty finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
