A Connecticut-wrapped gem that strays from the normal ho-hum mellow Connecticuts of the world and packs a hearty punch in the form of a luscious medium-bodied blend from Nicaragua. There is no question this elegant super-premium will compete with the industry’s leading brands, and promptly transform the traditional landscape of the Connecticut-wrapped cigar."}
