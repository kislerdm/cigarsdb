Blended with rare, secret, filler leaves, this cigar is powerful and mellow at the same time. The intrinsic flavors are accompanied with silky honey notes these leaves slowly release as you smoke the cigar. According to the characteristics of this format, the draw might be a bit resistant due to its length but when ignited, the heat warms the air channels of the cigar, turning loose its grand tobacco flavors of cedar accompanied with citrus fruity notes and a core of earthy and profound flavor of well aged tobacco."}
