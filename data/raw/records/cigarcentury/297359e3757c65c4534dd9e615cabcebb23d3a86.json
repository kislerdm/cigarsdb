Coming from Altadis, the same crew that gives us popular brands like Romeo y Julieta and Montecristo, this is a  highly-affordable option that doesn't skimp on flavor.  Utilizing Nicaraguan, Columbian, and Broadleaf filler and boasting a wrapper and binder from Nicaragua, this cigar delivers a robust medium to full-bodied experience with notes of leather, coffee and cedar."}
