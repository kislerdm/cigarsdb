It operated in various sectors of the tobacco industry such as growing and trading tobacco leaves from all over the world, including Germany, Indonesia, Cuba, Cameroon and other countries. La Estancia was created by two brothers, Jeremiah and Joshua, and is based on the tobacco heritage and expertise acquired by the previous four generations of this dynasty. Indeed, these high-end cigars are made in Honduras from carefully selected local tobacco leaves as well as from Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Cuba.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
