Out to make all inferior blends sleep with the fishes, this bold offering from CAO isn’t messing around. This perfect Malatov cocktail brings about a robust mixture of earth, sweet hints of cinnamon, and a nutty core. The Brazilian wrapper leaf is stunning on every sample that’s passed my desk, inviting you to indulge in just one more. The price for this one’s on point, the packaging is solid, the flavor is amazing. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":1}]}
