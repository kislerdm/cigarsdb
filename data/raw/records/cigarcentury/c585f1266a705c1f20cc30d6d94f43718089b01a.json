Within these walls, skilled artisans first created blends worth of donning the names Punch, Hoyo de Monterrey and Excalibur, just to name a few. The Villazon factory name may have changed to HATSA, but the time honored tradition remains. The Maduro version comes with an impressively oily wrapper leaf, shining with flavor. Toasting the foot, you’ll find hearty, toasty notes of warm tobacco, crisp peppery spice, and hints of dark chocolate."}
