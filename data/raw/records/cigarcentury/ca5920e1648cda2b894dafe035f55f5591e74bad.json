It is a medium strength cigar that features a Cameroon-seed wrapper that was grown in the Jamastran Valley in Honduras. The wrapper is carefully aged for two years before it is applied to the Corojo binder and filler. Once lit, the Aladino Cameroon delivers warm notes of spice with an underlying sweetness and creaminess.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
