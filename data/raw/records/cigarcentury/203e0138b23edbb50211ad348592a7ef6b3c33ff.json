Casa Magna Connecticut is made in the Dominican Republic and uses an Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper to encase a mix of Nicaraguan long-fillers creating a robust and intense profile that is capable of involving the totality of the palate. This full-bodied treasure offers up notes of subtle sweet woodiness, toast, earth and pepper.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
