He’s been making cigars for over 20 years and it doesn’t seem like he’ll be slowing down anytime soon. These days, he’s crafting premiums under the CLE brand in Honduras - top quality gems that I just can’t seem to get enough of. CLE Corojo will definitely grab your attention with its full-bodied profile and plethora of complex nuances. This cigar can easily be called a classic corojo with zesty notes of earth, black pepper, oak, and roasted coffee - all of which are followed up with long and smooth finish. "}
