Only 500 boxes (5,000 cigars total) of Louis the Last were produced at William Ventura's El Maestro factory in the Dominican Republic. Using the same undisclosed tobacco recipe as the Last Czar but with different fermentation processes on its wrapper and binder leaves, Louis the Last is remarkably unique in engaging taste, producing dense plumes of delicious smoke with each draw. Enjoy it here at an equally unconventional price break. This one’s dressed in a Connecticut Arapiraca maduro wrapper, which is a hybrid leaf not found on almost any other cigars on the market. They didn’t announce the fillers, but what I can tell you is that this cigar is chock-full of delicious flavors of cedar, cocoa, and pepper.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
