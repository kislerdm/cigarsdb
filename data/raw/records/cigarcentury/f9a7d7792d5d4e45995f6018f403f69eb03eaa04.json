Today, weâ€™re starting down the barrel at La Traviata Maduro, the spicier, richer follow-up to this winner of a blend. Swapping out the Ecuadorian Havana wrapper leaf for a thick and oily Broadleaf, La Traviata Maduro by CAO pleases the palate with intense spice notes over dark chocolate and roasted coffee.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
