The Ecuadorian binder and wrapper give it a complex, medium bodied flavor that delivers. As with all sun grown leaves the flavors have that subtle hint of pepper and spice but with a soft finish that brings your palate to another level. With a gentle finish and a clean aftertaste this cigar is perfect for any occasion that asks for something flavorful but not overpowering. It can pair well with a meal, a dessert, a favorite coffee or even a cordial and bring out the pure enjoyment found in smoking a premium cigar."}
