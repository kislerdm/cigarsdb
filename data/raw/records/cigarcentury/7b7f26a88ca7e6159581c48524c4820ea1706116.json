Their reputation for unsurpassed quality, with both flavour and construction, has amassed a loyal following among cigar connoisseurs. Nestled in the rich, volcanic soil of the Dominican Republic lies Chateau de la Fuente, home to the finest cigar of our time, the coveted Fuente Fuente OpusX. The mineral rich soils of the Dominican Republic, once deemed unsuitable for wrapper tobacco, had never met with the expertise and tenacity of the Fuente family. Together they cultivated a glorious wrapper tobacco that became the foundation for the renowned Fuente Fuente OpusX., the first ever Dominican Puro.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
