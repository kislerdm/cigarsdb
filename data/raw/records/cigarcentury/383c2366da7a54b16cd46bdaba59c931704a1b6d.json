An expertly crafted perfecto that delivers notes of spice, pepper, earth and cinnamon. This medium-strength stick sports a Nicaraguan maduro wrapper and a Honduran binder and filler. Handmade in Honduras, the Asylum Ten Limited Edition 11/18 celebrates this iconic brand’s tenth anniversary. Once rolled, each cigar is placed in a wooden coffin to protect its wrapper and preserve its flavor. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
