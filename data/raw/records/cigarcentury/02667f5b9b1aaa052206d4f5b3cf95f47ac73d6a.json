The filler blend is an astounding five ingredient cocktail of Nicaraguan, Peruvian, Brazilian, Honduran, and Dominican tobaccos. Add on the Ecuadorian wrapper and Mexican binder, and it’s clear why they named this cigar after a continent, not a country. The flavor here is a mixture of sweet coffee, roasted nuts, charred oak, and slight chocolate in a medium to full-bodied experience you’ll savor time and time again. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
