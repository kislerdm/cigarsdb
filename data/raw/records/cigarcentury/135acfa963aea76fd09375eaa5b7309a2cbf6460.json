So when we heard Nodal was teaming up with the folks behind Romeo y Julieta and Montecristo to create a new, Nicaraguan puro extension to the blend, it was needless to say we were grinning from ear to ear. Gentleman, welcome Aging Room Quattro Nicaragua. For the rooks out there, a “puro” cigar features 100% of its tobacco from the same country. So, this Nicaraguan puro is all Nica – wrapper, binder, and long-fillers. The result is exactly what you’d want: a medium to full-bodied overload of flavor, rife with crisp flavors that are peppery, zesty, and rich.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":91.2},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
