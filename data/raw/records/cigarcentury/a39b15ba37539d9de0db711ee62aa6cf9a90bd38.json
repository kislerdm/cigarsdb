The cigar is made at Nestor Plasencia’s Tabacos de Oriente SA in Honduras with a Nicaraguan Jalapa Habano wrapper, a Costa Rican binder and a filler of Honduran, Nicaraguan, Mexican San Andrés and Colombian tobaccos. Dark and oily, this well-made belicoso has a fine draw and even burn. Notes of leather and oak are supported by a consistent procession of Mideastern spices, brown sugar and coffee before the sweet nutmeg finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
