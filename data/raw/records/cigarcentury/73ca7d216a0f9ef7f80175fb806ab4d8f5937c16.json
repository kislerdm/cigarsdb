CAO Flathead features a 5 country blend that begins with a gorgeous Connecticut Habano Oscuro wrapper, and is finished with a Brazilian Arapiraca binder and Honduran, Nicaraguan, and Dominican long-fillers. Upon lighting, expect a wallop of flavor. This is an enjoyable full-bodied and complex cigar with hearty notes of spice, pepper, chocolate, oak, and coffee."}
