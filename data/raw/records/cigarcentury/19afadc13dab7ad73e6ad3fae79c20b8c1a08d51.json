Named after the Siboney tribe of indigenous people living in Cuba before the landing of Columbus. Their practices introduced the explorers to the use of tobacco. The rest, as they say, is history. Siboney is a Discontinued brand. It was a pre-revolution brand probably initially producing only cigarettes, with cigars introduced in the 1940/1950s. It was discontinued shortly after the Cuban revolution. The brand was reinstated in 1988 to produce mini-cigarillos for the Austrian market in partnership with Austria Tabak. One model of 'premium' cigar was also produced. The line was not particularly successful, and was discontinued in 1996."}
