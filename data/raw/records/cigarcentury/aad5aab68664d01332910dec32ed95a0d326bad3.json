This is AJ Fernandez in action, loaded for bear with a nearly-full mix of Nicaraguan tobaccos that smoke with an abundance of classic spice, wood and leather flavors; a Mexican binder adds sweetness. But what really sends this cigar over the top is the Ecuador-grown Habano 2000 wrapper, a Cuban-seed/CT Shade hybrid that puts on finishing touches of lush, earthy flavor."}
