Don’t let the name fool you, this cigar is anything but cute \u0026 cuddly. Inside a glistening Ecuador Habano wrapper and Ecuador Sumatra binder is a feisty blend of Nicaraguan Habano fillers, creating a profile that’s anything but tame but certainly not vicious. Full-flavored and medium-full bodied, the Hair of the Dog is a feat of tobacco blending prowess. A hearty dose of pepper, spice, and leather charges across your palate in perfect balance, with an excellent draw and burn throughout. "}
