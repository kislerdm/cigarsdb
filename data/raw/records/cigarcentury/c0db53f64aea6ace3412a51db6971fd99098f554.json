His dad worked in the industry, and like many cigarmakers, it was through him that he inherited his love of tobacco. He first started in the cigar business in 1997, spending the earlier days of his career working at a local cigar shop and helping his father at events; later, as an independent broker, he started working for household names like Drew Estate, Rocky Patel, and Alec Bradley; but that wasn’t enough, Erik’s passion ran deeper. After garnering high acclaim working with these prestigious manufacturers, Espinosa opened his own factory in Estelí, Nicaragua, called \"La Zona\", where he expertly crafts his very own Espinosa Cigars and later introduced blends like Laranja, Las 6 Provincias, and more. Espinosa searches the planet to find the world’s best wrapper, binder and filler tobaccos for every one of these highly regarded blends. He has cultivated his following by offering an innovative approach to blending full-bodied cigars, and that audience seems to grow exponentially as time passes. "}
