The 601 brand is now completely under the control of Erik Espinosa allowing for more focus on the brand and blend. After almost a decade, the 601 Black Label has returned, and it's sure to be as popular as the original was.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":85},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
