For centuries, the mountain has been an icon of Bahia, the state of Brazil known to grow the best tobacco. Lorenzo designed his logo and named the brand for this \nIn 2011, Lorenzo began experimenting with planting Habano seed tobaccos in these fields in addition to the traditional seeds. The result has been excellent. The new tobaccos have a clean, rich taste but are slightly richer than leaves grown from the traditional seeds. With some innovation, Lorenzo is continuing the traditions of Brazilian cigars. The brand has become one of the two top-selling premium cigars on the Brazilian market and is being sold by Tabac Benden in Germany and other companies around the world."}
