A flavorful and rich Sumatra-seed Sungrown wrapper is cultivated on the Oliva family farm in the highly fertile Quevedo region of Ecuador. Each leaf is hand-selected from the “Centro Fino,” (fine center) of the plant. Medium to full in body, Cuesta-Rey cigars are then patiently aged in Spanish cedar-lined cabinets, which bring out even more pronounced flavors. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2004","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2004","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
