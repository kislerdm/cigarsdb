Rob Holt, founder of Southern Draw, created the company because he wanted to bring back the \"Southern gentleman\" style of honor and respect. All of the tobacco used \nFor their core blends, Rob Holt decided to go with a plant theme; thus creating: Firethorn, Kudzu, and Rose of Sharon. Each line has a deep meaning behind it and the same care and compassion is put into each and every cigar."}
