However, once the blenders got a taste of the outcome, they stopped complaining and quickly got to work reproducing this \"happy accident.\" Comprised of American and Dominican filler leaves nestled within an Dominican binder and covered in an oily Oscuro wrapper leaf, the Blackbird Glitch Oscuro serves up a deep and delicious smoke at a fantastic low price. Medium in body and flush in flavor."}
