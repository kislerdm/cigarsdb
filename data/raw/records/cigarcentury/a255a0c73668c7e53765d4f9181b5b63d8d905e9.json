Blue is filled with a three-country blend of Nicaraguan, Dominican, and Honduran tobaccos that are all held together by a Honduran habano binder. Produced in the Dominican Republic but heavy on the Honduran tobacco, this new gem is an inviting medium-bodied blend that is rife with rich hints of sweet leather, earth, cream, and cinnamon.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
