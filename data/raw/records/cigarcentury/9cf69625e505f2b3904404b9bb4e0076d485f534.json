With a circular pilon the hands are carefully layered in a circular pattern, with the payoff being that the tobacco ferments at a slower rate which enhances the flavor. CAO Pilon comes dressed in a dazzling Ecuador Habano wrapper, encasing the binder and long-fillers from Nicaragua. This cigar is medium-bodied and packs flavor in droves with delicious notes of spice, cedar, pepper, nuts, and cocoa. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
