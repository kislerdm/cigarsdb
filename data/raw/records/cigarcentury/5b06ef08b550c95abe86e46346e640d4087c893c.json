While many companies were touting puros at that time, Liga was a four-country blend that included Brazilian Mata Fina wrapped in expensive, tantalizingly dark, broadleaf tobacco grown in Connecticut. It debuted in one size, and the bands appeared to be handwritten and resembled labels found in distillation plants or tasting laboratories. The brand quickly became a cult hit, and in 2009, Drew Estate added a line called Liga Privada T52, followed shortly by Liga Privada Unico Serie, which are a series of limited cigars that are all different in size and blend"}
