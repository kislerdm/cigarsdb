These limited-edition gems feature a sophisticated blend mixed with a top-shelf Ecuador Habano wrapper and binder over a whopping six-leaf combo of aged long fillers from Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico. My palate has an intensely complex full-bodied smoke effortlessly delivered by top-notch construction, and once lit, I experienced layer upon layer of espresso, malt, spice, white pepper, and cocoa. With these luxurious smokes being added to their top-rated portfolio.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
