But the kicker is a fuller, more robust flavor than the regular line that’s potent but not overwhelming. With a smooth and effortless draw. Lighting up the AVO Domaine, you'll find flavors of soft spices and an earthy core. It's a complex blend that stays interesting down to the nub. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2004","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2001","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
