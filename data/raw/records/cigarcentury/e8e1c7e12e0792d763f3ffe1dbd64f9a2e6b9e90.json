Newman quickly became a favorite among the P\u0026C Faithful, and maduro lover's rejoiced when the darker version arrived. But for a lot of us, even at their reasonable price, they had to be an occasional treat for budgetary reasons.Â Using clippings from their full-priced counterparts, Brick House Fumas Maduro are clad in a dark Sumatra maduro wrapper, come in mazos of 20, and at a price less than half that of the originals. These are medium-bodied cigars that have tons of flavor and very solid construction at a budget-friendly price."}
