It is a four-nation blend that starts off with an oily, dark USA Connecticut Broadleaf maduro wrapper, which covers a USA Connecticut Shade binder and a special filler made of premium tobaccos from Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. This limited-release stick has a pleasing sweetness that is complemented by a rich creaminess and subtle notes of spice, pepper and earth.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
