The beauty and tasteful yields of this breathtaking region result in an original and rich flavor profile, handmade in a handful of popular bigger ring gauge shapes. A savory medium-bodied blend of Nicaraguan, Honduran, and Connecticut Broadleaf long-filler tobaccos rests beneath the shimmering Honduran wrapper in a medium-bodied amalgam of wood, nuts, black pepper, and earth with a hint of sweetness. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
