Turrent’s Triple Corojo recently made its world debut at the June 4th Cigar Dave remote broadcast in Charlotte, North Carolina.  This follows the “Triple” theme that was set by last year’s triple maduro – the A.Turrent Triple Play.   For the case of the A. Turrent Triple Corojo, the theme is obvious – this cigar is all-Corojo.   The Triple Play was one of my favorite cigars from 2010. The Triple Play made an immediate impression on me when I first sampled it.   The question is – would the Triple Corojo do the same for me?   The answer is TBD – thus I’ve opted for a pre-review instead of a full assessment.  This also allows me to give some initial thoughts on the cigar in its “as is” state."}
