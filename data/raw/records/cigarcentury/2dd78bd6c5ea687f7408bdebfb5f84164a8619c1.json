Coming dressed in a gorgeous, oily, dark, Ecuador Connecticut wrapper concealing a Dominican binder and Nicaraguan, Dominican, and Peruvian Olancho long-fillers, AVO Syncro Nicaragua makes its presence known immediately. Medium to full-bodied, and with spot-on construction, expect a flavorful kick of spice and pepper before the cigar settles into notes of cream, leather, and cedar.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
