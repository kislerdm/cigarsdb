The blend is conceived from an all-Nicaraguan recipe of premium binder and filler tobaccos and a glistening reddish-brown Nicaraguan wrapper leaf. Tasting notes of leather, black pepper, and wood culminate in a medium-bodied profile handcrafted in Estelí, Nicaragua. A nutty, spicy, and rich finish emerges in a cool-burning collection of popular bigger ring gauge formats, including a box-pressed Toro, while the Gordo and Robusto are handmade in a round format.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
