A strikingly beautiful 2-story building that was once used as an Inn, is now the centerpiece of Erik Espinosa's cigar domain, and where you'll find his excellent staff of torcedores rolling 601 Steel cigars. This bold new blend features a gorgeous and extra dark Habano oscuro wrapper for a smoke that's tough as nails, yet easy on the palate. 601 Steel is a Nicaraguan puro that employs a super dark Habano Oscuro wrapper atop Nicaraguan fillers and binder. With each puff you’ll be attacked by a full-body profile. Strong indeed, but easy enough on the palate to enjoy. Off the bat you’ll be barraged with red and black pepper but a few minutes in, the intensity settles and enjoyable notes of coffee, cocoa, cream, nuts, and cedar ensue."}
