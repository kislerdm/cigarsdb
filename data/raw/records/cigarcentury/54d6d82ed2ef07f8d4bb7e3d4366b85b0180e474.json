Boasting an Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper, an authentic Corojo binder, and a perfect blend of Honduran and Dominican Aleman ligero long-fillers, you can expect a spicy kick that’s not too overwhelming. Referred to as a “utility cigar,” this is the handmade you’ll want to keep on hand for everyday use.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
