Made entirely of Honduran-grown tobaccos, this tasty cigar combines a top-notch mixture of aged long-fillers dressed in a leathery sun-grown wrapper from the Jamastran Valley of Honduras. The result is a buttery-smooth bouquet layered with earthy undertones, tobacco flavors, and sweet spices on the finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2008","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
