The tobaccos used are exquisite, making each cigar within the line a homerun from start to finish. Taken from the tobacco plant's highest primings, the Ecuadorian sun grown wrapper offers a rich, reddish hue and spicy, chewy flavor. The 4-5 year old Dominican long-fillers are masterfully blended to promote a smooth, but eventful flavor that's hearty and robust.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2003","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2002","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2001","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
