Showcasing a hearty Habano Oscuro wrapper over specially-selected Esteli \u0026 Condega leaves, each 601 PA cigar includes a single Pennsylvania Broadleaf in the filler to ensure an authentic taste of Pennsylvania in every stick. Handcrafted under the careful eye of Erik Espinosa at La Zona cigars in Esteli, the 601 Pennsylvania Edition welcomes you in with a wave of peppery spice before introducing its dense and layered profile with tones of smoky wood, subtle sweetness, toasted bread, and almond. A bold, complex smoke with medium-full body, the 601 PA presents a wealth of rich character to satisfy even the most seasoned cigar palate. "}
