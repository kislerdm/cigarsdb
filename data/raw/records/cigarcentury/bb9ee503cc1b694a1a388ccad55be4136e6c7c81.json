With their newest release, made in honor of Winston Churchill...and fittingly dubbed as such, the results are nothing short of extraordinary. Dressed in an attractive Ecuadorian Habano leaf, just above, a band is boldly displayed with Winston Churchill’s profile front and center. Its core is comprised of an impressive five different long-fillers, three hailing from the Dominican and two from Nicaragua, all of which are hugged by a sturdy Mexican binder. Medium-bodied, Winston Churchill delivers in flavor, featuring pronounced notes of cedar, dried fruit, and earthy nuances. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Katman","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":96},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
