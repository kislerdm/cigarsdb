Thanks to serving up a satisfying medium-bodied array of spicy-sweet undertones, there's a lot to look forward to. Featuring a gorgeous fourth priming Criollo ’98 wrapper and a balanced blend of Honduran and Dominican-grown Piloto Cubano long-fillers, it's got plenty of gusto too, but without all the knee-knocking strength Camacho is known for. That means you can get behind the wheel of this handmade almost any time of day. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
