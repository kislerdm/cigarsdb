La Aroma del Caribe is handmade in Pepin Garcia's Nicaraguan factory exclusively from Nicaraguan tobaccos cultivated from first generation Cuban seeds. Blessed with a potent, and very Cuban, spicy earthiness, these cigars also boast supporting notes of nuts, cinnamon and leather. A solid medium to full-bodied smoke, Pepin Garcia has outdone himself in constructing these beauties.Â "}
