So it was only a matter of time before the Scorpion got a cigar of its own. Available in both Connecticut and Sun Grown, today we’re looking at the darker meat. Camacho Scorpion Sun Grown cigars always have a ton of rich, natural sweetness, and Camacho Scorpion doesn’t disappoint. Handmade in Honduras with handpicked tobaccos, this Scorpion stings with a rich flavor profile, featuring a warm, sugary sweetness on top of black pepper spice."}
