Each cigar size is designat-ed with the prefix “PL”, standing for Punta Lanza (Pointed Lance), a term that one of Alan's  mentors once explained as the unique shape of a certain tobacco leaf. Their goal was to create a complex cigar that mimicked that unique shape and honored Alan's mentor. After six years of blending, Alan finally had “The Blend”  He was proud enough to call worldly. So proud, in fact, that they not only launched the cigars to Tobacconists; to celebrate, they actually launched them into space. Mundial features a brawny, chocolaty brown Honduran wrapper as well as a rich selection of Honduran and Nicaraguan binders and fillers. Medium-bodied in strength, these beauties boast a blissful bouquet of flavors including earth, spice, nuts and leather.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":94}]}
