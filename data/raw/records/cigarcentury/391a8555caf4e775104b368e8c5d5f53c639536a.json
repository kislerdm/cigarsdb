Like the rest of the 1502 line, it features a partially covered foot, a feature referred to as the cigar lock, and like the robusto, the Churchill uses a blend of tobacco from Condega, Estelí, Jalapa and Ometepe. The 1502 Nicaragua is a delightful cigar that has a unique taste to the cold draw. There are notes citrus, sweet cedar, roasted nuts, and noticeable hit of pepper. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
