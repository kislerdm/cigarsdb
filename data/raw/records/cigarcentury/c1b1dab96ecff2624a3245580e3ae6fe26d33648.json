Known for its classic creamy Dominican profile, full-bodied fans had been left out in the cold until legendary blender Omar Ortez stepped up to the plate with his bolder interpretation of this classic line. \nDon Diego Fuerte comes dressed in an Ecuadorian Cubano wrapper nestling a blend of Nicaraguan and Dominican long-fillers that mesh together marvelously, delivering a creamy but full-flavored assault on the palate. Full-bodied and unrelenting, this premium blend will dish out a large helping of flavors including rich earth, nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper, and cedar.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
