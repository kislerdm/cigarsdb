Super Deluxe handmade premium cigars may very well be the best in the portfolio. Super Deluxe cigars intend to capture a wide variety of top-rated flavors from other BLTC blends and combine them into a single ‘deluxe’ profile, and dare I say they accomplished this feat with flying colors. These smokes are made with extensively aged Nicaraguan long filler tobaccos that are tightly packed inside a spicy Ecuadorian Habano binder and completed by a top-quality San Andres Mexican wrapper that has a shimmering oily surface. The smoke that I get upon lighting is full-bodied, loaded with rich notes of dark chocolate, sweet cream, and hints of pepper that engage the palate yet are never overwhelming, providing a top-notch smoking experience that fellow seasoned smokers are guaranteed to enjoy."}
