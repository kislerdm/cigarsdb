A feisty recipe of premium Nicaraguan binder and filler tobaccos is bound by a toothy and succulent Maduro wrapper leaf. Cain is primarily made from spicy Liegero long-fillers. Notes of dark chocolate, espresso beans, hickory, and black pepper carries plenty of Cain’s signature zest. Cain Maduro is handmade to a flawless standard in a handful of ultra-popular shapes at the legendary Oliva factory in Estelí, Nicaragua. "}
