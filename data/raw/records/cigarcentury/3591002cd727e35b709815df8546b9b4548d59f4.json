One of the most recognizable names in the land, Cohiba has pumped out countless Dominican favorites over the years. This concoction of finely aged leaves boasts a bolder profile than many we’ve come to know from Cohiba. Adorned with a milk chocolaty Sun Grown Colorado Oscuro wrapper, this prize looks good enough to eat. Brimming with Nicaraguan long-fillers from Jalapa and Esteli all hugged by a Nicaraguan binder also from Jalapa, this is one medium to full-bodied masterpiece prime for the pickin’. Complex notes of cedar, leather, and pepper meld beautifully causing those who partake to begin frantically searching for another as soon as they see the nub is in reach.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Katman","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
