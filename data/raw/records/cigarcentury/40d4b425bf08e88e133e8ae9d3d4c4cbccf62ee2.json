The flavors are wonderfully influenced by the sherry casks, without becoming infused or overly sweet. Instead, youâ€™ll find notes of dark fruit, cedar, chocolate, and pepper, for a smooth medium-bodied experience that pairs great with any drinks with naturally sweet characteristics. Diesel crated something truly special \u0026 unique with this release.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":85},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":84}]}
