These cigars were created by famous composer and jazz pianist Avo Uvezian, with his passion for jazz, an irresistible charm, and an appetite for new experiences, Uvezian became a composer of fine cigars. As a way of life, he created rare and beautiful moments to be savored and shared by all. To share a moment with AVO is to immerse yourself in a merging of exotic flavors and cultures; in a timeless appreciation for the classics; in spontaneity, guided by inspiration. And within each cigar, you will find a unique experience, a shared moment, a thing worth remembering and passing on to friends both old and new. AVO cigars are produced in a variety of mild to medium-bodied profiles. Rich flavors of wood, spices and dried fruit accompany themes rooted in Avo’s love of music. Handcrafted in the Dominican Republic, AVO cigars achieve their complex characteristics from a variety of Dominican binder and filler leaves, as well as tobaccos from Nicaragua and Peru.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
