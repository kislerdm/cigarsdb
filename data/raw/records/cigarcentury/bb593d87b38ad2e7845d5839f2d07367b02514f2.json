This region is famous for its perfect tropical climate that results in exceptionally fertile soil, which in turn yields lush, thick tobacco leaf. This fine wrapper covers hand-selected filler tobaccos from Honduras and the rich volcanic growing regions of Nicaragua. This wonderful cigar starts with a blast of sweet spice that is soon joined by scrumptious layers of earth, cocoa, and cedar."}
