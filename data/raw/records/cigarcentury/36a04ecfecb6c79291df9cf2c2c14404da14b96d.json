When they got the green light, the managers were allowed to develop the blend and name the cigar for this limited-edition regional line. Steve Tucker, who manages the midwestern United States territories, created the Alec Bradley Highway Child. It is handmade at the J. Fuego Cigar Company factory in Nicaragua. The Highway Child features a dark, toothy Brazilian maduro wrapper that is draped over a Nicaraguan binder and filler. The cigar bears the name of a famous song. It is available in Michigan, Minnesota, northern Illinois, northern Indiana, and Wisconsin. Only 250 packs of 5 cigars per pack were made of the Alec Bradley Highway Child."}
