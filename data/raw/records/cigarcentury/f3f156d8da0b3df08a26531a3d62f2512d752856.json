And they got in good. Quickly releasing about a half dozen blends, each C\u0026A release has been met with loads of critical acclaim. But let’s not forget their roots \nCornelius \u0026 Anthony Meridian is manufactured in the La Zona factory in Esteli, Nicaragua, and sports a toothy, reddish Ecuadorian Habano wrapper leaf. Underneath, Nicaraguan binder and Dominican and Nicaraguan long-fillers meld together into a nutty core of flavor, featuring nice fruity sweetness and a sharp spiciness with a long, satisfying finish. "}
