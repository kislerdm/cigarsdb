Usually begin with Honduran Trojes wrapper, Honduran and Nicaraguan filler, and Indonesian binder. This medium-strength stick has some veining on a beautiful wrapper with hard to find seams. The colorful oversized band is marked with the label’s initials on it, while a second band on the foot spells the name out. The draw from the unlit Alec Bradley SCR delivers luscious fruity notes reminiscent of gingered apricots."}
