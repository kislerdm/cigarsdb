This wrapper leaf is dark and luscious, specially fermented using an old Cuban technique. The result is a rich, full-flavored blend that's smooth and balanced throughout. Notes of coffee, cocoa, pepper, cedar, and a slightly sweet finish characterize this complex new addition to the Alec Bradley line up.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
