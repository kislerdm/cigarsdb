James Brown selected the name for this cigar based on his time of living in Africa with his wife Angela. The cigars have shown some of the artesian qualities coming out of Brown’s Fabrica Oveja Negra factory. The sizes of Black Works Studio have tended to focus on the smaller connoisseur sizes. Hyena fits the model with its contemporary packaging, small batch production, and two Connoisseur sizes with production handled out of Fabrica Oveja Negra in Estelí, Nicaragua.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
