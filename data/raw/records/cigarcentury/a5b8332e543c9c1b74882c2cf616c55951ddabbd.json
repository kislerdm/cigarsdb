Atonement marks another project in the collaboration between AJ Fernandez and Justin Andrews who created the smoke in response to feedback from leading retailers and Diesel fans. They’ve been as supportive as they have been vocal, and they didn’t pull any punches when it came to telling us what they wanted for the TAA exclusive cigar this year. They asked for a full-bodied Nicaraguan smoke that balances strength and complexity, with a little something extra, and we delivered."}
