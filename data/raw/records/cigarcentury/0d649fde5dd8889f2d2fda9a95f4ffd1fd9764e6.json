The same father/son duo teamed up again, but this time they put their focus on delivering a refined blend of a more mellow character. The result, New World Connecticut, a true gem that enthusiasts new and old can enjoy to the fullest. New World Connecticut is not box-pressed, and the differences don’t stop there. At play is a conglomerate of vintage long-fillers from Brazil and Nicaragua. Encasing the filler tobaccos is a rugged San Andres binder, with a true U.S. grown Connecticut-shade wrapper leaf topping off this symphony of tobacco goodness. Mellow to medium-bodied, subtle notes of cream, slight spice, and cedar grow in intensity the further into the journey you get.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
