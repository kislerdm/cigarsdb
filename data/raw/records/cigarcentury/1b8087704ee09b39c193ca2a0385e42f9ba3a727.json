That box-pressed blend was the first AVO release to feature Nicaraguan leaf, and this one has even more. At the risk of being hokey: if it ain't broke, don't fix it! That typical Davidoff floral, grassy aroma was strong on the Ecuadorian Habano 2000 wrapper. After a quick clip and light, you'll find wood, leather, cinnamon, and a slightly sweet finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
