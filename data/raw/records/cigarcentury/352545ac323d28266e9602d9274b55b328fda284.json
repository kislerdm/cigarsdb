Asylum 13 offers bold blends with abundant flavor and craftsmanship that is nothing short of perfection - and the newest creation will blow your mind. Medulla Oblongata is composed of Honduran wrapper, binder, and filler - making this little puro a medium to full-bodied taste sensation with notes of leather, earth, espresso, and spice. What makes this cigar so unique is how itâ€™s packaged. Each box comes with a 50/50 split where half of the cigars are Medulla (round parejos) and half are Oblongata (box-pressed cigars).","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
