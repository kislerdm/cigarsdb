Toasting the foot, you'll find tons of charred wood, chocolate, black pepper, and a backing of natural tobacco sweetness - a combination that practically begs to be paired up with a few fingers of the good stuff. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2000","ratingOutOf100":82}]}
