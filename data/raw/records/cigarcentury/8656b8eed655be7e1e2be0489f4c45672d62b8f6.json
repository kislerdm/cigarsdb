The key to the blend comes in the form of a special Corojo filler leaf that’s aged for 6 years, only to be additionally stored in bourbon barrels to impart a truly unique flavor to an already stellar blend. The first Camacho to be produced in Davidoff of Geneva's prestigious Dominican factory, American Barrel Aged showcases bold notes of pepper, cashew, and sweet spices that are accented by a slight undertone of bourbon to deliver a blend you won’t soon forget.  ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Snob","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
