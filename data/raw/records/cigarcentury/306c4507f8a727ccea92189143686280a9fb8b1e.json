It’s a medium to full bodied Nicaraguan puro blend featuring the finest aged Cuban-seed tobacco grown in the most fertile regions of the country. The cigars are finished with a shiny, evenly colored mocha brown wrapper. Every puff on a 601 Gold Label cigar coats the palate with complex, well-balanced flavors of nuts, spice, earth, and rich, dark coffee, punctuated by a smoky, sweet smelling aroma.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
