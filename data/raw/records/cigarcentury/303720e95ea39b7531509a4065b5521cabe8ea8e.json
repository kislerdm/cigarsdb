Fernandez in Nicaragua, he was determined to make the cigar his own and exercised his creative freedom by putting together a blend of Nicaraguan tobaccos that he grew himself. With his name prominently displayed on the box and band, the Ramon Allones by AJ Fernandez is a bracing blend of medio tiempo wrapper, Corojo ’99, Criollo ’98 and a hybrid tobacco from Estelí. The other tobaccos are from Condega, Jalapa and Pueblo Nuevo, making this a true tapestry of Nicaragua’s major growing regions. Like many Fernandez cigars, the smoke is strong, showing a hearty mix of raisin and walnut notes with a tangy hint of cedar.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
