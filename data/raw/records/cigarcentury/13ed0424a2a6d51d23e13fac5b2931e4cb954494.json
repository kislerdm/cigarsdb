They’re hand-rolled using fine Nicaraguan leaves and a blend of traditional black tobaccos from around the world including St. James Parish, Syria, Turkey, and the Dominican Republic among others. These blends give each label its own unique and complex flavor ranging from mellow to bold, complemented by Cameroon, Sumatra, Connecticut, or Connecticut Broadleaf wrappers to further enhance your experience. "}
