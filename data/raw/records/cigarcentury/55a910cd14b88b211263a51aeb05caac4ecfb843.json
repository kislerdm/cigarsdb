Stunning full-bodied premiums showcased in uniquely designed boxes make them a showstopper for sure. The handmade cigar line represents the sweat, blood and tears poured into the industrial and agricultural production of well-made cigars. Complementing the already popular Hammer \u0026 Sickle vodka line, the same name was used for the cigar brand which launched in 2010. A new addition to this stellar portfolio is Berlin Wall, beautifully wrapped in a Honduran Criollo wrapper and filled with Corojo long fillers to deliver notes of leather, earth, and wood. "}
