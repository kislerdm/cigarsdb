Medium to full-bodied, this decadent beast comes dressed for battle in a dark and oily Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper. A peek under the armor reveals a luscious and hearty blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers setting the table for a flavorful feast at the round table. Flavors abound, including hearty and pleasing notes of dark chocolate, coffee, leather, cedar, with light spice playing in the background for the duration."}
