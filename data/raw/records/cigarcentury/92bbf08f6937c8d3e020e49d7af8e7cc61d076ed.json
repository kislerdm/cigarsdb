Prior to the Serie M’s release, non-Cuban Cohiba cigars, which were first rolled in the 1980s, have been made in Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. The Serie M is hand crafted at the globally recognized El Titan de Bronze, which is a family-owned cigar factory located in the historic Little Havana neighborhood of Miami, Florida. The factory’s cigar crafters create the cigars from start to finish, which unlike other factories that assemble the cigars in teams. It is a medium to full-bodied cigar with a bold, rich creamy profile.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":85},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
