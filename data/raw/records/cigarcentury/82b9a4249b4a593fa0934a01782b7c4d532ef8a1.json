That cigar would be the Nestor Miranda Special Selection. At the time, Miami had built a reputation distributing cigars for others – most \nIn 2014, Miami Cigar and Company made a decision to sunset the Nestor Miranda Special Selection blends and replace it with the all-new Nestor Miranda Collection. The Nestor Miranda Collection would grow to four blends. While Nestor Miranda Collection would do quite well for Miami Cigar and Company, there were requests to bring back the Special Selection line. With 2019 being the 30th anniversary of Miami Cigar and Company, the company decided to bring back the Rosado blend of the Special Selection."}
