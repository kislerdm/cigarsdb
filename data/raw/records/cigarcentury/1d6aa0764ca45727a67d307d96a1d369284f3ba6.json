Yes, Dr. Gaby Kafie is a real doctor, \nThe Kafie 1901 tobacco is aged for a minimum of 3 years meaning that you should be tasting none of that “freshness” or ammonia found in some cigars. To quote Dr. Gaby Kafie, “The past 3 generations all shared one thing in common, a love for fine cigars. This brand represents the historical influence that \"puro's\" have had on our daily lives. Excellence takes time and patience to achieve. KAFIE 1901 Cigars was created for those that are looking for that classic, well-aged, flavourful cigar experience.” "}
