Sultry Nicaraguan wrappers are stretched over an amalgam of long-filler tobaccos from Columbia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and San Andr√©s. Medium to full-bodied notes of earth and cedar with toasted spices deliver oily, luscious flavors in a prolonged finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
