The original Henry Clay cigars, the first Henry Clay made outside of Cuba, is produced by Altadis U.S.A. in the Dominican Republic with fully aged Dominican binder and long-filler tobaccos, finished with a Connecticut broadleaf maduro wrapper. Although its rustic appearance will never win any beauty contests, these cigars have been a long time favorite for those who enjoy a maduro wrapped stick with intensely delicious notes of chocolate, spice, dark roast coffee, and leather. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Daily","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
