It features a mouthwatering Dominican HVA (Havana Vuelta Arriba seed) wrapper placed over a Dominican Criollo binder, and a filler composed of Criollo leaves of an undisclosed origin. Due to its long aging process, the Pepper Cream Soda offers a taste-quenching flavor and aroma that will not lose its fizzle from first puff to last. The Caldwell Lost \u0026 Found Pepper Cream Soda Habano Robusto is a small batch release cigar that is part of the Lost\u0026Found project, which was founded by Robert Caldwell and Jaclyn Sears of Caldwell Cigars along with Tony Bellatto of La Barba Cigars.Â "}
