Carefully-crafted with a synchronization of long-fillers from Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, a binder from Ecuador, and topped with a Dominican wrapper. Available in 3 vitolas, this medium to full-bodied blend traces the roots of AVO in the Dominican Republic. This selection showcases a lively, dynamic, and harmonious profile of Caribbean flavors: aromatic spices and complex cocoa ebb and flow throughout the smoking experience, accompanied by a subtle sweetness reminiscent of tropical fruits. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
