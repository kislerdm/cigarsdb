Blended by family patriarch Julio Eiroa, the Camacho Select line is his rebellion of sorts against stronger cigars. Camacho Selects are easygoing and balanced, with nutty flavors and some dry notes. The Eiroas are tobacco growers as well as cigarmakers, and Julio has been growing in Hondurasâ€™ Jamastran Valley since 1962. Many of the cigars he makes are puros, but the Camacho Select is a hybrid, combining Honduran leaf with Cameroon, a somewhat uncommon blend. It makes for a cedary, earthy and nutty smoke with a pleasant smooth character.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
