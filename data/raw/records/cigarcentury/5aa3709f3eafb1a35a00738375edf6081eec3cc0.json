For the unique factor, Brown created the cigar to have a signature linear cap, made of strips of natural tobacco wound around the Maduro wrapper resembling bee-stripes.Â The dark Ecuadorian Maduro wrapper encases fiery Nicaraguan binder and filler that produces a full-bodied profile, filled with notes of pepper, earth, and wood that make a bee-line for the palate and swarm the senses.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
