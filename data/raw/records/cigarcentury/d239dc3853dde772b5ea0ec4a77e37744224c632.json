More often than not, the name Tatuaje comes to mind immediately upon hearing his name.Â Series JJ is another. Created by Pepin and his son Jaime, this fine handmade employs a wonderful blend of Nicaraguan Corojo and Criollo long-leaf tobaccos inside a flavorful Nicaraguan Corojo wrapper. The result is a full-bodied smoke layered with deep flavors. The aroma is earthy and spicy, complementing the rich, leathery flavors perfectly.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Katman","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
