In a press release, James Brown, creator of Black Label Trading Co., said that he wanted to change things up a bit for this year’s release, which resulted in the addition of the Ecuadorian maduro wrapper being added. “The dual wrappers work together to make this vintage very unique and one of the best so far,” he said, calling this year’s release “rich and earthy with bold spice on the retro” and identifying raisin, black cherry and anise as specific tasting notes."}
