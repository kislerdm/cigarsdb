The Entubar is a premium smoke that Maduro lovers will truly enjoy. Featuring a blend of Dominican and Nicaraguan long-filler cloaked in an alluring Mexican San Andres Maduro wrapper, this release by Berger and Argenti is back after a 5 year hiatus to revive their most popular cigar in 5 box-pressed sizes."}
