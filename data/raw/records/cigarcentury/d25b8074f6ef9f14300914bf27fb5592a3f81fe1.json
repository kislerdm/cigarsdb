For the Rock-A-Feller Vintage Habano cigar, the blend makes use of an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper, allowing for a classic, zesty experience that sits nicely between the darker Red Label maduro and milder Blue Label Connecticut. This Habano leaf surrounds an Ecuadorian binder and fillers from Nicaragua's Estelí, Jalapa, and Ometepe growing regions. The Rock-A-Feller Vintage Habano cigar has been a popular choice for craft enthusiasts for some time, offering up a medium body and zesty flavors from start to finish. This includes standout notes of cabinet spice, toasted bread, cedar, and medium-roast coffee beans."}
