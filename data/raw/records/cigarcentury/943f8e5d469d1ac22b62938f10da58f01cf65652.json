Even before then, this famed castle was the Scottish residence of the British Royal Family. It was during the reign of Queen Victoria that the crafting of tobacco products really began to soar. The values of virtue, worthiness, and craftsmanship are now forever associated with the Victorian period. These are values that are still treasured in the crafting of Balmoral's select cigars. Comes with a Mild cigar from the Dominican Republic with aromas of earth and leather and short filler cigar. The filler-tobacco is from the Caribbean, the binder is from the Dominican Republic and the wrapper is from Ecuador."}
