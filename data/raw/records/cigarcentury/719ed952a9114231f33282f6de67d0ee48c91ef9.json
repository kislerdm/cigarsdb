From the first draw, you will be knocked off your feet , and thatâ€™s not exaggeration. The powerhouse of spice, pepper, cocoa, and leather notes coat the palate with each puff. There is also a hint of sweetness in there somewhere; it is a generous layer, keeping the blend complex and balanced, but these gems are no cakewalk. The blend consists of expertly aged Nicaraguan long filler and binder tobaccos that are flawlessly draped in a top-quality Habano leaf. If you are looking for the deepest, boldest, and most powerful smokes, there is nowhere to look beyond the La Bomba cigars.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
