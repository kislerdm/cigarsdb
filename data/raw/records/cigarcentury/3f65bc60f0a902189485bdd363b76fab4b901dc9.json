After all, with this bold new blend, CAO has unleashed atruly exotic cigar straight from the Amazon rainforest. The CAO Amazon uses a limited tobacco called “Braganca” foundin the Amazon Basin rainforest, which is harvested only once every three years. the Braganca is combined with tobaccos from fiveother countries in order to develop a truly unique filler blend, creating infull a bold, zesty, and spicy flavor profile.
