This highly regarded tobacco comes from the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. The Crown Vintage has 3 different finishes. Crown Red has a dark and oily wrapper for a sweet and full flavor. Crown Yellow has a darkish mocha tone with an Ecuadorian sun grown wrapper for a spicy flavor. Crown Green has a light Connecticut wrapper for a milder, smooth smoke. Taste rivals that of Padron Anniversary, Rocky Patel Vintage and My Father."}
