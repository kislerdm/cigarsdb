A classic blend that appeals to all smokers, Exactus was developed, blended, and headed up by Radhames “Ram” Rodriguez, the grandson of company founder Don Pulita. Ram sought to blend a cigar using a specially fermented leaf he helped develop. Comes with strong barnyard notes with undertones of hay and sweet lemon zest. With  Shade-Grown Connecticut Seed wrapper, Dominican Criollo ‘98 binder and Specially fermented Dominican blend filler. "}
