It was a fantastic cigar, one that collectors and enthusiasts have searched after for years since it disappeared from the market. Now they are back in stock. Graycliff Original uses a rarely seen Indonesian wrapper that lends the blend its characteristically smooth flavor. This leaf is lovingly draped over a motley crew of tobacco including Brazilian, Dominican, and Nicaraguan long-fillers. Combined, the blend booms out clouds of rich smoke, all balanced with layers of earth, spice, and a satisfying mellow sweetness."}
