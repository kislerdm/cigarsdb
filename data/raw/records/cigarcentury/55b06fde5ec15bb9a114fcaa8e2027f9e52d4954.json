To honor the rich history of this sought-after tobacco, Alec Bradley created the 1633 Connecticut. An exquisite blend of Panamanian, Honduran, and Nicaraguan long-filler tobaccos are nestled inside a Costa Rican binder, which is expertly wrapped by a light-brown Connecticut wrapper to create the Alec Bradley 1633 Connecticutâ€™s medium-bodied flavor profile."}
