This cigar is a Honduran puro that uses aged, premium 7 year old tobaccos resulting in a medium to full-bodied blend. You can expect your palate to be carpet bombed with flavors of red pepper, baking spices, chocolate, espresso, cream, wood, and leather. This stick is a slow burner with complexity, balance, and displays a pleasing evolution of flavors.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
