And one of the most historically significant American cigarmakers is none other than LA PALINA, since 1896. Most cigar enthusiasts associate heritage cigar manufacturers and marcas (brands) with Cuba, however, \nIn 2010, Bill Paley revived La Palina, a brand his grandfather created in Chicago in the mid-1800s. At the start, the cigars were expensive and manufactured in the Bahamas. The brand soon gained traction in the marketplace and now includes several lines that have garnered several scores of 90 points or higher. Additionally, La Palinas are also manufactured in all the major non-Cuban cigar producing countries, including Miami's El Titan de Bronze factory.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
