The foot appears to have a subtle bell on the finish, and the cap has a lovely pigtail finish. Natural to Colorado Maduro in coloring, the cigar is soft and there are medium sized veins throughout. Aromas of cedar, cocoa, coffee beans and herbs. Strong coffee bean notes.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
