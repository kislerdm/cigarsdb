The Curivari Buena Ventura is a medium-bodied pleasure that is quickly reserving permanent residence in humidors world-over.Â A modest band sits atop a classic blend that is quickly gaining fans left and right. A milk-chocolate Nicaraguan wrapper encases vintage long-fillers from the black volcanic Nicaraguan soils to give this puro a distinct character all its own. Pronounced notes of cedar, pepper, and nougat all make appearances with a subtle undertone of sweet spice showing face on the finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
