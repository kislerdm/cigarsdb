The bourbon barrel aged binder is a Mexican San Andres leaf, and it’s all held together five-years aged Ecuadorian habano wrapper. The barrel aging produces a strong oaky flavor and hints of bourbon in the aroma. You’ll also notice some floral notes, spice and some sweetness in a medium-bodied format.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
