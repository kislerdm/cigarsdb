At the core of this cigar you’ll find plenty of lush, extensively aged Nicaraguan long-fillers from the Jalapa Valley, Esteli, and Condega. Clad in a Honduran Jamastran wrapper leaf, this CAO booms out with a full-bodied blast of pepper with a core of nuts and toasty tobacco backing it up. Sure to become a best-seller like Brazilia and Italia before it, CAO Nicaragua is destined for greatness. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
