Handmade in the Dominican Republic, Alpha cigars are known for producing some of the best flavor-infused cigars in the business. Alpha Cigars solely focuses on creating cigars instilled with absinthe (an alcoholic spirit commonly referred to as “the green fairy”). Alpha uses a light-infusion method to ensure the absinthe flavor does not overpower the cigar’s natural tobacco flavors. All Alpha cigars are made using the entubar method, which is a traditional Cuban way of rolling cigars to ensure an excellent construction, which produces a perfect draw. Aside from their absinthe-infused cigars, Alpha has a non-flavored infused line to satisfy aficionados who crave their cigars straight up."}
