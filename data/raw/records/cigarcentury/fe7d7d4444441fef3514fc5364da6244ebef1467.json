This was the last blend created by the late Carlos Fuente Sr. He learned from his father Arturo about Cuban cigars' experience and flavor. Carlos Sr. selected an Ecuadorian Havana wrapper tobacco, chose a mix of Cuban-seed Dominican grown long-filler and binder, and blended them in the same way he blended Cuban tobacco many years ago. Each vitola or cigar size is named after a dominoes piece. Arturo Fuente Casa Cuba will delight those who prefer a full-flavor, medium to full-bodied smoke.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Snob","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
