These tasty leaves conceal a robust combination of long-fillers from Honduras and Nicaragua, with a dash of La Estradas leaf in the mix. After significant post-roll aging, this eventful cocktail serves up a bouquet thatâ€™s rich and hearty throughout. Toast, charred oak, nuts, espresso and black pepper smack every last taste bud, and the strength is more than satisfying.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2004","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2002","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2001","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
