This project between the companies has grown to mythic proportion over the years and showcases some of the tastiest AGANORSA Leaf tobaccos. For this special release, the blenders have conjured up a surprise for cigar lovers who aren’t afraid to try new tobaccos. This is a new dog with new tricks that showcases premium binder and filler tobaccos straight out of Nicaragua. To add to the excitement of this medium-full release, you’ll get to taste a Corojo 2012 wrapper, grown in Nicaragua by AGANORSA. This new variety of Corojo will add some serious tasting notes that hit on rich spice while remaining smooth and true to the signature flavor and aromas.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Katman","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
