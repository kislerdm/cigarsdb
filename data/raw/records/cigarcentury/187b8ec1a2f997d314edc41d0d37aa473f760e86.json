Cigar wise, it represents Mi Querida personal maduro desires: a robust, extremely flavorful liga comprised of rich Nicaraguan leaf hand rolled in a 100% naturally fermented, heavy Broadleaf capa. Earthy \nMi Querida is handcrafted at the recently renovated NACSA cigar factory under the stewardship of their new Master Cigarmaker Raul Disla at my direction. Packaged simply in understated boxes, this brand is an expression of the greatest value possible for the hardcore cigar enthusiast. As always, the pace of its production is being dictated by the tobaccos themselves and therefore it will be limited in its availability via Select Purveyors for the foreseeable future.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
