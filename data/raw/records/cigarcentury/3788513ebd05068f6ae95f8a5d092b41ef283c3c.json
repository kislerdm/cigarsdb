Using different vintage Dominican Cuban-seed tobaccos chosen from various stages in the aging process, then rolled in a sun-kissed Dominican wrapper, the result is a full-bodied, yet seductively smooth smoke with non-stop flavor from beginning to nub. The Aging Room Solera Sun Grown is a medium-bodied iteration of the blend. Once lit, you’ll find notes of maple, slight nuttiness, and a citrusy zest. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
