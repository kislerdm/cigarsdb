The Serino Wayfarer is the first blend released by Carson who has spent his entire life around the cigar industry. The Wayfarer started out as Carson Serino's personal cigar, and \n\"For this project, we wanted to create a traditional Cuban styled cigar with new era branding. we implemented traditional Cuban rolling methods and used original Cuban molds, including the very 109 mold that has crafted some of Cuba's most memorable cigars,\" commented Gonzalez Aleman. The blend for the Wayfarer features an Ecuadorian Corojo '99 wrapper, Jalapa binder, and undisclosed Nicaragua fillers. As with the other Serino Cigar Company lines, the Wayfarer is produced at Omar Gonzalez Aleman's La Corona factory in Esteli, Nicaragua."}
