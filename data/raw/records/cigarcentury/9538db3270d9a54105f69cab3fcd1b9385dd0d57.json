The solera process was developed in Spain and Portugal for aging wine, beer and brandy. It is used to fractionally blend varying ages of a product so that the finished product is a mixture of all ages. Aging room uses this process to combine different vintages of tobacco and obtain a fuller flavor profile. Comprised of Dominican fillers and a silky Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper, this beautiful medium bodied cigar produces a bounty of creamy flavors and offers a smooth and consistent draw. A complex and extravagant premium delivers an unforgettable cigar experience."}
