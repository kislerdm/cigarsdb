Now owned by General Cigar, the Don Tomas blend was reworked in 2005 in an effort to get back to the brands roots as a no-nonsense, hearty cigar for a fair price. Eliminating blended tobaccos from all over the world, the reworked blend is now back to the original Honduran and Nicaraguan tobaccos that put this brand on the map.Don Tomas Clasico features a combination of select long-fillers and supremely superb construction giving way for an easy draw and even burn. Crafted with a silky smooth wrapper and Nicaraguan and Honduran fillers, This Don Tomas cigar is surprisingly complex, with toasty, woody and slightly sweet flavors."}
