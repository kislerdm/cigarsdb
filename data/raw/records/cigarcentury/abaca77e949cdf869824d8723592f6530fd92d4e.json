The blend is pleasant, with a toasted almond flavor, notes of wood and touches of leather on the palate.\" The Black label is as inviting as it is delicious. Coated with a caramel-colored Corojo wrapper, this eventful blend of Cuban-seed tobaccos hails from the black, fertile soils of Nicaragua. The result is a full-tilt array of flavor swirling throughout your palate with undeniable hints of earth, toasted cedar and black pepper.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
