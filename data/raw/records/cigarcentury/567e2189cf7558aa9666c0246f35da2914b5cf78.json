It is a powerful cigar full of strength featuring bigger sizes and robust flavors. It offers a peppery opening that morphs into a smooth, earthy body with notes of coffee and cedar. Each cigar is delicately constructed using unique tobaccos that are hand-selected by Francisco Almonte himself. The sun grown Ecuadorian Sumatra wrapper coupled with the Peruvian binder create a mouth-watering experience that is truly satisfying. The all-Dominican filler includes the island’s most prized tobacco, Piloto Cubano. "}
