Their next step to stepping into the limelight is the Golden Blend 10 year which is part of an ambitious venture that began in 2013 to create a full flavor cigar using the best tobacco leaves in their possession, forty percent of which was harvested in 2004. In 2010, The D’Crossier Golden Blend Series was made known with a mild to medium blend of exclusive tobacco aged for seven years with a unique profile and superb aromas. Now, these magnificent cigars feature five traditional vitolas, which features Ecuadorian wrapper, Dominican binder and fillers from Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic."}
