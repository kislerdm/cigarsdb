This one size, 7\"x50 Churchill, is comprised now of an Ecuadorian Sumatra binder and Nicaraguan filler. These two delicious tobaccos were hand-picked by CAO blender and brand ambassador Rick Rodriguez to complement the stunning Cameroon wrapper's natural sweetness. Clocking in at a medium to full-bodied experience, this cigar will ignite your palate with notes of leather, espresso, and spice. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2009","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
