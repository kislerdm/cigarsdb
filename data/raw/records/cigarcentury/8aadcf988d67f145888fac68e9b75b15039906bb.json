Maintaining the same blend as the highly-rated Colorado, this premium is filled with carefully fermented premium Nicaraguan long-fillers covered by a Nicaraguan binder. The result is a well-balanced yet complex cigar with notes of pepper, cocoa, nuts and cedar. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
