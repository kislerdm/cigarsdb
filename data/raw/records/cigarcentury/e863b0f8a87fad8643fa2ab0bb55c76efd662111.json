The foot of the Basilica is shaped to resemble a canon when fired. This unique foot design also serves as way to ease the smoker into the Basilica's full-bodied flavors. The Casdagli Basilica is available in two blends. The Basilica \"A\" is blended with the prized Bonao leaf. The Basilica \"C\" uses a blend composed of up to 7 distinct tobaccos. Both blends were specially selected by Hendrik Kelner Jr. of the famous Kelner family of Master Blenders at the KBF factory, which is located in the Dominican Republic.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":96},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
