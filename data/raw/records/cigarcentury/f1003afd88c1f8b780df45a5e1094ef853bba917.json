After all, with this bold new blend, CAO has unleashed atruly exotic cigar straight from the Amazon rainforest. The CAO Amazon uses a limited tobacco called “Braganca” foundin the Amazon Basin rainforest, which is harvested only once every three years. the Braganca is combined with tobaccos from fiveother countries in order to develop a truly unique filler blend, creating infull a bold, zesty, and spicy flavor profile. Outside, the CAO Amazon iswrapped in an oily Ecuadorian Sumatra ligero – which features a twisted tobaccoband, symbolizing old Brazilian rolling methods – and bound in a Nicaraguan binder.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":83}]}
