With a combination of flavors like that, this gem will surely make itself comfortable in any enthusiast’s collection. Perfectly balanced at a nice medium-bodied profile. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
