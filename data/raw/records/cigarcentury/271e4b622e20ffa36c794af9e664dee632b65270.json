First introduced by Rafael Nodal in 2011, the concept behind Aging Room was to create an exceptional line of boutique blends all rolled in small batches using the finest and rarest tobaccos all perfectly aged to perfection. Aging Room Quattro Maduro cigars keep the brands winning streak alive by showing off the darker side of Rafael Nodal. The blend is composed of the finest estate grown Dominican binder and long fillers covered by an oily and dark San Andrés Maduro wrapper, that all leads to flavors of chocolate, earth, black pepper, wood, and sweet cream. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
