The bourbon barrel aged binder is a Mexican San Andres leaf, and it’s all held together five-years aged Ecuadorian habano wrapper. The barrel aging produces a strong oaky flavor and hints of bourbon in the aroma. You’ll also notice some floral notes, spice and some sweetness in a medium-bodied format.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Katman","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
