This top-rated line features a wide array of sizes certain to fit any palate preference. These gems are blended with expertly aged Nicaraguan long filler and binder tobaccos that are cloaked with a top-shelf Connecticut Habano wrapper leaf that has a dark brown hue. Each gem is hand crafted with top-notch construction at EP Carrillo’s famous Tabacalera La Alianza cigar factory by the best rollers in the building. My personal favorite size is the Headley Grange Dobles, a 6.12 × 50-sized Toro that provides my palate with balanced medium-bodied notes of chocolate, leather, and deep spice flavors. These gems are a worthy addition to any cigar aficionado’s humidor, and their warm and inviting flavors make them suitable for any palate. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":82}]}
