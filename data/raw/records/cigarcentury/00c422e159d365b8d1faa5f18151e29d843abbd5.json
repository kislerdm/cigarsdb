Their first series, Fourth Prime, is the story of the number 7 and the significance it holds in our world. The size names of this compelling series reflect the fourth prime number. Fourth Prime contains a long-filler, medium-full bodied blend of some of the world’s most sought after tobaccos. The triangle logo is a minimalist representation of the fourth prime number – seven. Seven lines that form the letter P when turned sideways.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
