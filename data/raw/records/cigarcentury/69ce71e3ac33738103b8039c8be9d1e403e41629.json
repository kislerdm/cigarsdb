This blend boldly showcases a four country long-filler mix of Dominican, Nicaraguan, Italian, and, you guessed it, American tobaccos. Expect a rich, chewy profile, loaded with cream and oaky nuances. The finish is short and sweet, but don’t be fooled — CAO America is a robust, medium to full-bodied beast.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
