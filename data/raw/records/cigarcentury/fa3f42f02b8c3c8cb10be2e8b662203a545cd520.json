Know more for their infused lines, Drew Estate has also had traditional masterpieces like Undercrown and the Florida Sun Grown line.  Keeping on that path, their new line of premium cigars also features Florida-grown tobacco from Jeff Borysiewicz’s \nDrew Estate’s master blender Willy Herrera constructed the 20 Acre Farm blend starting with a golden Ecuador Connecticut wrapper. Underneath that sits a Sun Grown Honduran Habano binder over Nicaraguan long-fillers from Estelí and Jalapa, and of course the previously mentioned Florida tobacco. The result is a unique medium-bodied profile with notes of oak, cedar, white pepper, and hints of citrus on the palate. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Public","year":"2025","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Katman","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":65}]}
