It consists of an Ecuadoran Connecticut wrapper around a blend of less powerful Honduran and Nicaraguan tobacco. Those are made in Altadis’s Flor de Copan factory in Honduras. The new full-bodied Gispert Intenso goes in the opposite direction and is another recent example of Altadis’s willingness to partner with other cigar makers for novel interpretations of its heritage brand. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Katman","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":79}]}
