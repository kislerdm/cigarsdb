No exaggeration. Grand Cru celebrates the heritage of this highly prestigious line, honoring the original blends and sizes made by Zino Davidoff. Grand Cru is a cigar that immediately impresses. Gazing upon this fine specimen, you’ll note the seamless, smooth Ecuadorian-grown Connecticut wrapper leaf, and the timeless Davidoff artwork. Most importantly, lighting it up, you’ll find a bouquet of complexity that only Davidoff can provide. Buttery and nutty in the beginning, Grand Cru develops subtle spice, cedar, and that signature Davidoff “grassiness” as it burns. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
