The new line debuted in 2007 as a collaboration between Habanos S.A. and Max Gutmann, who is the owner of Importadora y Exportadora de Puros y Tabacos (IEPT), the importer of Habanos for Mexico. Due to trademark concerns with the Montecristo brand in Mexico, because of the design similarities with Montecristo, it was long rumoured that these were Montecristo cigars, sold under the Edmundo Dantes brand because of 'copyright issues' in Mexico. Gutmann joined up with Habanos to create the new brand named after Edmond Dantès, the protagonist in one of the French author Alexandre Dumas’ most famous books, “The Count of Monte Cristo” that was published in 1844.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
