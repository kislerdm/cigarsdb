To craft the American Classic Blend cigar, an aged recipe of long-fillers from Nicaragua is secured inside a bold Nicaraguan binder, then cloaked by a lovely Connecticut-seed Honduran wrapper. The flavor is mellow to medium-bodied â€” smooth, and teeming with satisfying flavors. A rich core of tobacco is complemented by sweet notes, nuts, and a touch of coffee, while the finish is long, woodsy, and soothing on the palate.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
