An all-star lineup of bold traditional English mixtures created by Alfred Dunhill, his pipe tobacco is sought after by serious pipe connoisseurs year after year. Made from the finest tobaccos there's a Dunhill cigar for every palate,  From the medium-bodied 1907 blended with Dominican ligero and Brazilian Matza Fina filler, to Heritage a full-bodied cigar that received an impressive 93-rating for its hearty Nicaraguan and Honduran peppery tobaccos, Dunhill offers a portfolio that every cigar enthusiast will enjoy. "}
