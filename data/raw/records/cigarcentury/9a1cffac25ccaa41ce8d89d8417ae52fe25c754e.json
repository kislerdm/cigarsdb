Now owned by General Cigar, the Don Tomas blend was reworked in 2005. Don Tomas Clasico features a combination of select long-fillers and supremely superb construction giving way for an easy draw and even burn. Crafted with a silky smooth wrapper and Nicaraguan and Honduran fillers, This Don Tomas cigar is surprisingly complex, with toasty, woody and slightly sweet flavors. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
