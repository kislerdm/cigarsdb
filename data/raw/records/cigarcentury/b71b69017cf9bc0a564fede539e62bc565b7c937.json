Each line, Doorman, Stoop 526 and Yellow Cab, presents a different packaging: Ecuadorian habano, Mexican San Andr√©s maduro and Ecuadorian Connecticut respectively. All the mixtures use a Nicaraguan cigar binder and fillings from the regions of Condega and Jalapa in Nicaragua. In addition, they are offered in three different sizes. The idea behind Flatbush Cigar Company came up during a conversation about the cigar industry at Flatbush. These cigars promise to be fantastic and the brand plans to introduce more creative ideas in the future."}
