Taking its name to heart, Concert piles on strong musical influences and doesn't look back. Concert is an entirely new creation built from the ground up. Patiently crafted and blended, this complex blend delivers from the get go. It all starts with a rare, oily and leathery Ecuador Habano Rosado wrapper. This welcoming leaf hugs a Connecticut Broadleaf binder and a complex four region long-filler core of Honduran and Nicaraguan tobaccos. Together, this ensemble produces a rich medium to full-bodied offering delivering balanced flavor in spades. Billows of thick smoke prod​uce chewy notes of nuts, gentle spices, coffee and toast. Also joining the fray is an undeniable creamy tobacco note, rounding out this new handmade in grand fashion. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
