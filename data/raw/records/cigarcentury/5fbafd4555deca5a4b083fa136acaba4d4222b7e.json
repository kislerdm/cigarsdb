This Honduran puro sports a mouthwatering, rustic Habano seed maduro wrapper placed over a Corojo binder and a Habano seed filler. All of the tobaccos for the Classic were grown at the JRE Tobacco farms in Jamastran, Honduras. It offers a medium-strength and flavorful smoking indulgence that will take you back to a simpler time. The cigars are handmade at the Fabrica de Puros Aladino S.A. factory in Honduras.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Public","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
