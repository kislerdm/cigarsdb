Under the old system it was considered a multi-local brand. It has a minor market share.The range comprises full strength cigars using tobacco from the premium Vuelta Abajo region.There is a non-Cuban brand of the same name.In 1954, following the death of José Fernández Rocha, the Cifuentes family purchased the Bolivar and La Gloria Cubana brands from the Rocha family. Production of Bolivar cigars was then moved to the Partagás factory. Not all Bolivar cigars are made at the Partagás factory these days, but Partagás remains the primary factory for the Bolivar brand."}
