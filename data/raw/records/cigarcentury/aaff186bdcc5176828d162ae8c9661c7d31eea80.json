Despite CAO using a process that takes longer to cure their leaves, they added in an additional two years of aging that provides a well-balanced experience. The name Pilón Añejo roughly translates into \"aged pile,\" which is a technique that has been around since the 19th century to cure tobacco. Rick Rodriguez, CAO’s blender, choose a new blend for this release. A combination of Dominican and Nicaraguan fillers bound by a Honduran binder. To complete this well-aged cigar, CAO went with an Ecuadorian Sumatra wrapper."}
