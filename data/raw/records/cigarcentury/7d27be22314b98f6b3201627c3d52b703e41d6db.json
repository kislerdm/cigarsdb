But while he pays homage to his Greek heritage in name, he pays tribute to Cuban cigars by making his boutique cigars from Cuban-seed, Nicaraguan-grown tobaccos and then tops them off with a triple cap. Named after the one-eyed giant that fought Odysseus in the epic poem “The Odyssey”, the Curivari Ciclope is a full-strength stick that sports a sweet Mexican San Andres Maduro wrapper with a Nicaraguan binder and filler."}
