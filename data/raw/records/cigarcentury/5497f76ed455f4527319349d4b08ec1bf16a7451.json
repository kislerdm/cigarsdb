The following year at the 2015 IPCPR Trade Show in New Orleans, three new lines were added to their already extensive portfolio for such a young company. Manufactured in Esteli, Nicaragua at the Plasencia Cigars S.A. factory, the Crux Guild features an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper over Nicaraguan binder and filler tobaccos. The Crux Guild wears a wrapper that has an initial milk chocolate appearance, but, as I move into the sunlight, I am able to see a deep red hue to the cigar with darker markings. There are a few scattered bumps, no tooth, and only small veins. The cigar is rolled evenly and firmly with no soft spots to be found.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
