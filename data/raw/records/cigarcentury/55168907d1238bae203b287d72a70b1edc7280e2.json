The Habano leaves used in Puck’s filler are the very same leaves utilized in some of the brand’s higher-priced lines, and are gracefully covered by a dark \u0026 oily Honduran Habano wrapper. Hand ‘em out to your friends and they’ll think you paid twice as much when they get a taste of the rich notes of espresso, pepper, and cocoa. Truly another winning blend from Alan Rubin."}
