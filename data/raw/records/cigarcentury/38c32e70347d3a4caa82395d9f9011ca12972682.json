Carrillo to create a tasty little cigar called Anastasia, named after a Russian Princess. These cigars were highly limited due to the availability of the wrapper leaf they chose to use. They only shipped to a small group of retailers across the country and they quickly disappeared from the market. Now dubbed Anastasia H, they swapped the original wrapper with a well-aged Habano leaf. Just like the original, the rest of the blend is being kept a secret but we’ve been told all the tobaccos are rare and have been patiently aging in the Tabacalera La Alianza factory. It clocks in as a medium to full-bodied blend with notes of caramel, spice, leather, and a creamy smoothness."}
