This Nicaraguan Puro is full-bodied and moderately priced. Comprised of Ligero and Viso fillers from several different regions of Nicaragua and a beautiful Cuban-seed Ligero Colorado wrapper, the Casa Magna is hand-rolled in Plascencia's Nicaraguan Factory. The result is a smooth, rich, full-bodied cigar with undertones of coffee and sweet spices.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
