Stepping up the cigar in terms of body and flavor, each one of these handmades booms out thick notes of black pepper, leather, espresso, and earth. Plus, each box features a 50/50 split of half round cigars and half box-pressed ones, allowing you to experience two uniquely nuanced versions of this showcase cigar.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
