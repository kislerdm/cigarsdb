The cigar gets its curious name from Richard Reith who was a major in the Army. Richard, avid cigar smoker, was the grandfather of Ian Reith, who is the founder of the Dapper Cigar Co. The cigars feature a savory, dark Habano maduro wrapper placed over a Honduran binder and mixed-filler leaves. This medium-strength cigar is perfect for smoking while playing a round of golf or while enjoying a weekend BBQ."}
