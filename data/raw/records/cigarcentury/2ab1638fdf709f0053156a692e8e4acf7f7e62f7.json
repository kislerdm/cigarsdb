A muestra is the vision of the ligador and torcedor realized, it is the promise of a new experience and possibly the key to financial \nMuestra de Saka is just that. A line of unique blends and vitolas made in extremely limited quantities that reflect the blending machinations of myself. They include many different expressions and are often crafted of leaf I am less familiar with or not even a particular fan of to create something of worth beyond my own previous experiences. To smoke a Muestra de Saka is to embark upon a journey with me in which I greatly welcome your companionship.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Katman","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":100}]}
