The folks over at Crowned Heads are  sticking to their musically themed cigar lines and have decided to honor Cash with their newest release, Jericho Hill. One of the most influential American singer/songwriters of all time, \nJericho Hill boasts a dark and sultry Mexican San Andres wrapper, which is a nod to both Juarez, Mexico, where Willy Lee was arrested, and to Johnny’s nickname, “Man in Black.” Nicaraguan long-fillers and a Nicaraguan binder help to give Jericho Hill some serious attitude (just like Johnny had). Stuffed to the brim with blasts of pepper, spice, and leather, this is one full-bodied firecracker. Only the most potent of blends would suffice in paying tribute to a legend of Johnny Cash’s stature, and this one fits the bill.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
