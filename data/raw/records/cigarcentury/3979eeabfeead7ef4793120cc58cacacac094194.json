Villiger made a small amount of La Flor De Ynclan over 10 years before its release, but Heinrich Villiger was unsatisfied with the results. The tobacco was set aside to age and the \nLa Flor De Ynclan was blended by Jose Matias Maragoto and rolled at ABAM Cigar Factory in the Dominican Republic. The blend uses an Ecuadorian wrapper, Indonesian binder, and filler from Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
