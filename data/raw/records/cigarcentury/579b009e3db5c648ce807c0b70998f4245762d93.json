Eight years in the making. The cigars are made of only Honduran Tobacco, becoming a Honduran Puro. The blend of these handmade cigars is exquisite and tasty. If you like the Asylum Line, you will find the resemblance and taste of these premium smokes' quality. While the sizes are the same, the blends are different. Last year’s cigar used a Nicaraguan wrapper over Honduran fillers, this year the entire cigar is made of Honduran tobacco.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":97}]}
