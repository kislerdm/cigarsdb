This delightful cuban style cigar as a delicious profile of flavors. At first light up there is a note of white pepper with a subtle hint of roasted coffee. Further into the cigar there are flavor notes of cedar, earth, and quick spirts of citrus.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
