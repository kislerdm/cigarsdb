To commemorate his achievements, Christian released his Eiroa the First 20 Years line, with his first blend receiving a well-deserved 90-point rating. His follow up, Eiroa the First 20 Years Colorado combines a leathery Honduran Corojo wrapper with long fillers from Honduras - all put together in a box-pressed package. Medium to full-bodied with a delightful array of espresso, oak, and cinnamon."}
