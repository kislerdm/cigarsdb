Now the proud owner of a half dozen fan-favorite lines, this boutique offering has been working overtime the last few years to quickly establish a name for themselves. Aerial, a cigar handmade in the La Zona factory in Esteli, Nicaragua. A proprietary USA binder that adds loads of spice and complexity to the Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapped treat. The typical cream and slight cedar are there, joined by droves of black pepper and a natural grassiness."}
