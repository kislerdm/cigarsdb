The tobaccos used are exquisite, making each cigar within the line a homerun from start to finish. Taken from the tobacco plant's highest primings, the Ecuadorian sun grown wrapper offers a rich, reddish hue and spicy, chewy flavor. The 4-5 year old Dominican long-fillers are masterfully blended to promote a smooth, but eventful flavor that's hearty and robust.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
