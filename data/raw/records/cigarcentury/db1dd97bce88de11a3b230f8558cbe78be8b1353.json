There are two blends released as part of the collaboration; the black-banded Oscuro uses a Connecticut broadleaf wrapper, Ecuadorian Sumatra binder, and fillers from the Dominican Republic, Honduras and Nicaragua. The red-banded EMS blend keeps the filler the same but flips the wrapper and binder, meaning an Ecuadorian Sumatra wrapper and Connecticut broadleaf binder.Â Both blends are offered in the same two sizes."}
