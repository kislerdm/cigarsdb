A Honduran puro, the Aladino Corojo Reserva, as it name clearly states, uses Cuban-seed Corojo tobaccos to create a full-strength stick and a classic flavor profile that consists of earth, cedar, tobacco and pepper with a floral touch. The Aladino Corojo Reserva is one premium cigar that, once smoked, will earn a permanent place in your humidor.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":97},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":95}]}
