It impresses with the strength of the Nicaraguan filler tobaccos, without neglecting the most important thing: the taste. This is only possible through a careful selection of the best tobacco varieties and leaves, which give the Dapper El Borracho its full-bodied aroma. Due to the nutrient-rich volcanic soil, which provides the tobacco plants with excellent minerals, Nicaragua offers excellent conditions for high-quality tobacco cultivation - and you can taste that with the Dapper El Borracho. The finest tobaccos from Esteli, Jalapa and Condega are used for the filler, which are wrapped in a Rosado binder from the Jalapa Valley. The aromatic San Andrés Natural wrapper from Mexico gives the cigar a pleasant spiciness that flatters the taste buds. "}
