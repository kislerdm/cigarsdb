Their branding, packaging, and product line names are designed to appeal to people like them — “warfighters” looking for a good cigar. Based in San Antonio, Texas, the company partners with manufacturers in cigar producing countries and imports their finished products into the United States. The cigars come in a sleeve that’s designed to look like the box magazine on a Barrett M82, with the cigars as the cartridges. It’s a great touch for a brand devoted to military and veterans.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
