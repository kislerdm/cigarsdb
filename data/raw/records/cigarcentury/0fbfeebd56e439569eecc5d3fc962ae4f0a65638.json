While the White Series is the flagship, the Black Series is rated very highly and holds its own among beginner cigars recommendations thanks to its medium strength and body. Black Series II, which is a line in its own right but serves as a sequel to Black Series I when you're ready to move on to something that is both similar yet also different. The cold draw is complex and carries a selection of scents that hint at the journey ahead. Sweetness is present as caramel, cream and butterscotch, along with a spice rack of aromas including cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper. Cavalier Black Series cigars have a rustic construction with lumps and bumps, but the exposed seams are tight. The end is not just a triple cap, but a coiled pigtail finish, one slightly less common feature that helps these cigars to stand out.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
