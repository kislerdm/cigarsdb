The finest, aged Dominican Olor and Nicaraguan Esteli leaves are mixed with Balmoral’s stalk-cut Brazilian Mata Norte, the special leaf responsible for most of the amazing flavors you get from Agio’s premium brand. It took Royal Agio quite some time to perfect this medium-full bodied blend, but when the rich earth and espresso flavors hit your palate."}
