For the 2019 edition of this release, Cohiba only produced a limited number of boxes, and the cigars were crafted by one artisan rolling and one bunching to ensure the highest quality possible. They start with an exquisite, extra-fermented Nicaraguan wrapper that’s supple, rich and full of flavor. It’s then brilliantly combined with the finest Brazilian, Nicaraguan, and Dominican filler tobaccos that have been carefully aged in rum barrels in order to enhance their natural sweetness. Finally, the craftsmen have brought it all together with an exquisite 5+ year aged, wrapper-quality Connecticut Broadleaf binder proving that Spectre is pure mastery.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
