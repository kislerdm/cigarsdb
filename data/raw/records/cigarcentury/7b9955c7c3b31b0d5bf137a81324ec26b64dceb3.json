The tiny seeds are raised in climate controlled greenhouses. There, skilled farmers hand-select the very best leaves. The plants are raised in nutrient-rich soil where experts continually monitor the tobacco to ensure that each leaf bears the specific characteristics set forth for Cohiba. Once the plants have reached maturity, Cohiba farmers handpick the tobacco. Even with the great attention given to the crop, only a small portion of it will be deemed worthy of becoming Cohiba. The leaves are hung in special wooden sheds where they are cured to express moisture and release natural sugars. During this process, agronomists monitor the tobacco closely, as this is when the flavor of Cohiba begins to take shape. Cohiba's signature aging and fermentation techniques are applied to the leaves. This includes a year of finishing in Dominican rum barrels to enhance the flavor and aroma of the tobacco. Every Cohiba is handcrafted by master cigar makers selected for their expertise. According to a time-honored tradition, artisans call upon the knowledge passed down to them to ensure that each and every Cohiba cigar is flawless, both in appearance and construction. After the cigar is rolled, numerous tests are performed to ensure every Cohiba lives up to exacting standards. The result is a cigar that defines a luxury smoking experience.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
