The flavors are wonderfully influenced by the sherry casks, without becoming infused or overly sweet. Instead, youâ€™ll find notes of dark fruit, cedar, chocolate, and pepper, for a smooth medium-bodied experience that pairs great with any drinks with naturally sweet characteristics. Diesel crated something truly special \u0026 unique with this release.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
