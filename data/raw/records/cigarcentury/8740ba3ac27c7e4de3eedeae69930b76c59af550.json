It was discontinued in the early to mid-1960s.It was reintroduced in 1989 as a low cost machine-made brand. It was deleted from Habanos portfolio circa 2005, and production moved to Internacional Cubana de Tabacos S.A. (ICT), albeit with new sizes and branding. It became Cuban domestic market only around 2014. The range comprised medium strength cigars.Before circa 2005 the cigars were reportedly machine-made with long-grain short-filler tobacco, which is to say the shreded tobacco used was in larger pieces than in conventional short-filler. Since 2005, the cigars were made using normal short-filler tobacco.Â "}
