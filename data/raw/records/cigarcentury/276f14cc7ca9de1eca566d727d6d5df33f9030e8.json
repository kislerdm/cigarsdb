His dad worked in the industry, and like many cigarmakers, it was through him that he inherited his love of tobacco. He first \nIn 2003, he partnered with Eddie Ortega to launch E/O Brands-United Tobacco. This company saw the birth of brands like Cubao, 601, Murcielago, and others, and by 2011, the company had built a legion of fans. E/O was eventually absorbed by Rocky Patel; but Erik still had a fire in his belly. Within a year of the merger, Erik launched Espinosa Premium Cigars. He opened the La Zona factory in Esteli, Nicaragua and got started with new versions of 601 and Murcielago, and later introduced blends like Laranja, Las 6 Provincias, and more. "}
