All but impossible to find these days, Crowned Heads listened to the cries for more and resurrected the exact same blend in a regular production cigarâ€¦meet La Imperiosa. Hailing from the My Father factory in Nicaragua, this hearty blend comes lovingly dressed in an oily and dark Ecuadoran Habano Oscuro wrapper concealing a choice blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers. La Imperiosa is full-bodied and oh so delicious with highlights of red pepper, fruit, earth, and leather.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Katman","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
