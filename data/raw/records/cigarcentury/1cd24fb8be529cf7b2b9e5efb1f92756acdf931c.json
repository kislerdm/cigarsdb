Created by Rafael Nodal, owner of the Oliveros brand of cigars, and made by Jochi Blanco of Tabacalera La Palma in Tamboril, Dominican Republic, the Aging Room brand is the duo's best effort to date. The 2011 launch of Aging Room was delayed due to the scarcity of some of the tobaccos used to make the cigars. The cigars are made entirely of Dominican tobaccos, including some Habano-seed ligero. There are four sizes in the line, and we were most fond of the smallest, known as the Presto. This shorter, thinner version of a robusto was simply brimming with hickory notes and roasted nuts. Aging Room Prestos are not made in great quantity, so the cigars are a tough find, but they are definitely worth the search.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
