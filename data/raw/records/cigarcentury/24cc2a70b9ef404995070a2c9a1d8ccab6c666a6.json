The core is composed of bold Nicaraguan and Panamanian long-fillers, secured within a feisty Mexican binder. Hugging this stout core in place, a dark and oily Nicaraguan maduro wrapper. The profile is strong yet balanced, as a dense series of rich tobacco, toasted oak, and hearty spices shine through the highly satisfying bouquet. "}
