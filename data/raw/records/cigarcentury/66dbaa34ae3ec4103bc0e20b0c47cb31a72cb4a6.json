With their newest release, made in honor of Winston Churchill...and fittingly dubbed as such, the results are nothing short of extraordinary. Dressed in an attractive Ecuadorian Habano leaf, just above, a band is boldly displayed with Winston Churchill’s profile front and center. Its core is comprised of an impressive five different long-fillers, three hailing from the Dominican and two from Nicaragua, all of which are hugged by a sturdy Mexican binder. Medium-bodied, Winston Churchill delivers in flavor, featuring pronounced notes of cedar, dried fruit, and earthy nuances. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
