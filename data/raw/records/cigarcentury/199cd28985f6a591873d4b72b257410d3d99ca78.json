The outermost leaf is an ultra-dark, super oily Connecticut Broadleaf Maduro. Underneath, there’s a second wrapper leaf — fuller-flavored Brazilian Maduro. On their own, each of these wrappers would be high-quality enough. But combine the two, and you’ve got something completely stunning. To mix the pot even more, the folks at CAO use a blend of select long-fillers from Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru, and the Dominican Republic to complete this complex handmade. The resulting profile is packed with layer after layer of spicy, sweet flavors.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2008","ratingOutOf100":84}]}
