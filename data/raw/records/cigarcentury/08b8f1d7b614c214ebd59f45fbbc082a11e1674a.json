Today, he's out to conquer Nicaragua. Enter the Asylum, a gorgeous, boutique lovely showcasing the very best Nicaragua has to offer, let alone the raw blending talents of Eiroa himself. Asylum 13 cigars are true Nicaraguan puros. A dark, Nicaraguan Habano wrapper cloaks a feisty combination of aged Cuban-seed long-fillers grown throughout the black, volcanic soils of Nicaragua. Upon igniting, one can expect a complex, medium to full-bodied array of flavorful, Nica-influenced goodness, along with a slow, cool burn letting you fully appreciate every last nuance. Earth, cocoa, espresso bean, black tobacco, sweet notes, and gentle spices.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":85},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":81}]}
