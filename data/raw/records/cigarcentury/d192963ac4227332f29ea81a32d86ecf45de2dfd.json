This special cigar features a full composition of Maduro, from filling to wrapping, using bold Nicaraguan and Pennsylvania Broadleaf Maduro tobacco, a Connecticut River Valley Broadleaf Maduro folder, and a Mexican San Andres Maduro wrapper. With flavors of leather, dark chocolate and espresso, Blackened M81 is perfect for those with bold palates and reflects the creators' dedication to premium cigars.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Public","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":80},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":89.7},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
