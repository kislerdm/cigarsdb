But rest assured, it delivers in spades. Draped in a flawless Ecuador Connecticut wrapper, and chock full of aged long-fillers from Honduras, each CLE Connecticut dishes out a barrage of soothing flavor. Hints of roasted nuts, cream, leather, and a dash of spices enter the fray before a long crisp finish.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
