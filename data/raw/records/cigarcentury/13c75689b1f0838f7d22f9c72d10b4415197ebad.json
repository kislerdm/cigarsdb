While it shares a size with the 2020 version, this one is round as opposed to being box-pressed like its predecessor, and it wears a new secondary band design. \nThe Cavalier Genève Limited Edition 2021 starts with a bit of dry wood and toast, the former reminding me of barrel wood that has been thoroughly dried out after its intended use and might now be more decorative than anything. There is a bit of pepper floating around, and while it hits multiple parts of the tongue, it doesn’t yet focus on one particular area.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
