Similar to the Eastern Standard, Midnight Express features a top-shelf hybrid, but this time between a Connecticut Shade and a Brazilian Arapiraca. Under the hood is a spicy Dominican Habano binder that is deftly packed with vintage Dominican Criollo ’98 and Corojo along with Nicaraguan Habano long filler tobaccos. This blend of masterfully aged leaf from Caldwell Cigars provides a savory medium-full bodied smoke with complex notes of spice, espresso, cedar, leather, and a caramel sweetness that balances the mouth wateringly good flavors."}
