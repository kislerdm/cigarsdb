The foot of the Basilica is shaped to resemble a canon when fired. This unique foot design also serves as way to ease the smoker into the Basilica's full-bodied flavors. The Casdagli Basilica is available in two blends. The Basilica \"A\" is blended with the prized Bonao leaf. The Basilica \"C\" uses a blend composed of up to 7 distinct tobaccos. Both blends were specially selected by Hendrik Kelner Jr. of the famous Kelner family of Master Blenders at the KBF factory, which is located in the Dominican Republic."}
