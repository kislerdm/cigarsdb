The New York was created to help retail stores deal with the enormous cigar excise tax placed on retailers in New York, where the cigar tax is 75%, the highest in the nation. The blend consists of a Criollo '98 wrapper and binder, both of which are grown in Trojes, Honduras, and filler tobaccos from both Honduras and Nicaragua, which make this a rich medium to full-bodied smoke teeming with luxurious flavors.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
