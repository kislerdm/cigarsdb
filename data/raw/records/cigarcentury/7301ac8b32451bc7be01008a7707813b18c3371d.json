Perfectly medium-bodied, this cigar features both a Corojo wrapper and binder encasing a flavorful mixture of Corojo and Criollo filler sourced from the renowned Aganorsa fields which come together to provide creamy notes of pepper, cedar and vanilla. Indulge in this homage to the protector of the leaf who, just like a cigar smoker himself, takes tobacco very, very seriously.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Katman","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":95}]}
