First launched in the late 1980’s, the original El Rey del Mundo cigars are handmade in Honduras with aged Honduran binder and long fillers covered by your choice \nThese handmade premium gems immediately took the industry by storm with its bold earthy, nutty, and rich Cuban-style flavors. Then, in the mid 2000’s the company crossed the Honduran border into Nicaragua to create an exciting blend for a completely different way to enjoy El Rey del Mundo cigars. Beautifully constructed and slow burning, El Rey del Mundo Reserva Nicaragua cigars are medium to full bodied in strength, and brimming with intensely delicious flavors of earth, cocoa, and cedar, all enhanced with a nice spicy kick, and a lovely sweet tobacco finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
