This 4-country blend is jam-packed with Jamastran, Honduras and Panamanian long-fillers, capped off by a lively Sumatra binder and powerful Nicaraguan wrapper leaf. Upon first lighting, the blend burns with purpose. Unique and satisfying arrays of flavors greet your palate, as spice, pepper, and peaty undertones finish the ensemble. With a long dry finish, and slow burn, the Black Market cigar is a finger burner.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
