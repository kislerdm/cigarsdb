Blended by Pete Johnson, and hand-crafted in Pepin's My Father Factory, each cigar shows up to the big stage well prepared. Dressed to impress, each L'Atelier comes cloaked in a bold new wrapper leaf known as 'Sancti Spiritus' - a hybrid of Criollo and Pelo de Oro. Grown in the misty valleys of Ecuador, this beautiful leaf boasts a wonderful aroma, and houses a rich core of Nicaraguan long-fillers. Together, this recipe strikes up medium to full-bodied, containing meaty notes of spice, cedar, earth, dried fruit, and a long hearty finish. The cherry on top is a beautiful pigtail cap.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
