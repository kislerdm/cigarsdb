A medium to full-bodied profile of molasses and black pepper delivers hints of citrus and cedar with an earthy aroma. Classic, handcrafted shapes showcase a somewhat coarse, veiny wrapper leaf in a blend that offers a distinct richness and depth.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
