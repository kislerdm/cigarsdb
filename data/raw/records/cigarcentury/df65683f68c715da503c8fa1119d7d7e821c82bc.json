Now, though, it has reached a comfortable pace with its releases and has managed to hold onto its original vision even while gathering momentum. Nomad Cigars released their first blend with the start of the company back in January 2012 and has produced several since. The initial release, known as the Renegade, is made with an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper, a Dominican binder, and Dominican fillers. It’s a medium brown smoke with medium veining, and the cold draw offers brown sugar along with wood and spice notes. Once lit, the stick’s flavors include some spice, cream, wood, cherry pepper and a flavor some reviewers described as grilled hot dogs.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Katman","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":96}]}
