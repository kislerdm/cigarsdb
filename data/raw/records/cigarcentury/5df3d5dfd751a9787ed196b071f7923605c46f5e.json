An oily Brazilian Arapiraca Maduro wrapper houses a blend of premium Nicaraguan long-fillers and a Nicaraguan binder. The bold, full-bodied flavor profile is punctuated by notes of cocoa and sweetness. Slow-burning, firm in hand, and deliciously tasty, itâ€™s a fitting follow-up that will easily work its way onto your top ten list.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Public","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":70},{"who":"Katman","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Katman","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
