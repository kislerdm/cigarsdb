These authentic and tasty vitolas are Alejandro's heart project. Rolled in his favorite format of 55 x 6.5, they seduce with their unique aroma, which is the result of the stored tobaccos: all the leaves of the capes have been aged for at least 5 years, and for the undercaps and tripe, small batches of different tobaccos, each aged for 10 to 12 years, are used, depending on the blend. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
