Known for their fuller bodied blends, Cusano went on the mellow side with this one. And, to compete with many of the high-end Dominican cigars, the M1 uses the classic combination of Dominican fillers nestled inside a blonde-hued Ecuadorian Connecticut-seed wrapper. For some extra Cuban-style gusto, the Cusano M1 uses a double binder process that uniquely reinforces its overall construction and bumps the complexity up a notch while still remaining mellow in body and strength."}
