Carlos “Carlito” Fuente Jr. sought out to prove that notion wrong, and planted 37 acres of Cuban seeds at Chateau de la Fuente. Those wrappers would go on to become the foundation of the OpusX blend and showed the industry that the Dominican Republic could produce wrapper-grade leaves. The Fuente Fuente OpusX 25 is a 7 x 50 Churchill, and while the OpusX line was known for its Dominican puro blend, the company has not disclosed any details about the tobaccos that are used in this cigar.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
