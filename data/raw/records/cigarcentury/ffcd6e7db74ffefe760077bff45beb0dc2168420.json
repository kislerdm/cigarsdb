The overall makeup of the cigar is similar, though not exactly the same, as the Camacho Triple Maduro. The wrapper leaf was not really much darker than a milk chocolate brown color, with a nice oily feel to it and just a bit of a sheen in the light. I got a fairly strong earthiness from the wrapper, along with a bit of espresso bean aroma. The foot of the stick had more earth, some leather and bittersweet chocolate.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":85},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
