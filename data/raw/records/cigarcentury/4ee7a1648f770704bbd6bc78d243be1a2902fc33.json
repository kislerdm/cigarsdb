So while the Cornelius \u0026 Anthony name may be new to the world of premium cigars, you can rest assured knowing you’re still looking at generations of history and knowledge of growing and cultivating tobaccos. Wrapped in a rich Brazilian wrapper leaf, the Daddy Mac also features Ecuadorian binder and Nicaraguan long-fillers. Handmade in the La Zona Factory in Esteli Nicaragua, each Daddy Mac delivers a medium to full-bodied profile that’s layered with sweet and spicy flavors. It’s a perfect balancing act, one that we’re sure will make Papa Bailey proud. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
