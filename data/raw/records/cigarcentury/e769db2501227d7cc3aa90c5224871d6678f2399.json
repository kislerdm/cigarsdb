The cigar is rolled in just one 6 x 50 Toro size with a dark, oily Broadleaf wrapper, an Ecuador Habano binder, and a core of fully aged Nicaraguan long filler tobaccos. Boasting a mellow to medium bodied profile, and brimming with inviting flavors of pepper, oak, espresso, dark chocolate, and cream. "}
