At that point, Caldwell decided to slate Añejado 2016 to be released prior to a fourth—and still unreleased—Anastasia. Anastasia Añejado 2016 is the first of what will be at least two new Anastasia lines scheduled to be released on year 2022. As the name implies, these cigars were rolled in 2016 though they aren’t the same as the original Anastasia. Instead, it’s a completely different blend—a Dominican habano mejorado wrapper over an Indonesian binder and fillers from the Dominican Republic—and it’s made at a different factory."}
