All of Casdagli's cigars are hand crafted at the famed KBF factory under the direct supervision \nThe Casdagli Basilica gets its name from the massive canon used by the Ottomans during the siege of Constantinople in the 15th century. The foot of the Basilica is shaped to resemble a canon when fired. This unique foot design also serves as way to ease the smoker into the Basilica's full-bodied flavors. The Casdagli Basilica is available in two blends. The Basilica \"A\" is blended with the prized Bonao leaf. The Basilica \"C\" uses a blend composed of up to 7 distinct tobaccos. Both blends were specially selected by Hendrik Kelner Jr. of the famous Kelner family of Master Blenders at the KBF factory, which is located in the Dominican Republic."}
