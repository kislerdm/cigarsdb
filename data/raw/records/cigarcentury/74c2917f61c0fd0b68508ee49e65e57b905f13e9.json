Originally, smoking was an exclusive privilege of the shaman, known by the name of Sukia, from Cabo Camarón, in Honduras, to Río Grande, in Nicaragua. These master healers used tobacco leaves to practice medicine and initiation \nThe Umnum brand, as part of the dream of its creators, was born to pay a humble tribute to all the indigenous peoples who have used tobacco as the axis of fraternal union among all the members of their community. For this reason, the Umnum ring incorporates the image of the spirit with which the sukias fraternized, under the black background that represents the world of dreams. The colors gold (Umnum Nicaragua) and copper (Umnum Honduras) symbolize fire and ash, inseparable elements of tobacco. To smoke Umnum is to undertake a dream journey through time and space to share the best smokes with the first tobacco smokers on Earth."}
