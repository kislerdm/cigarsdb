Translated in Portuguese for ‘Thank you’, this blue labeled Habano is a Nicaraguan Puro from the Plasencia factory. “The Obrigado was the first-ever blend from Jim \u0026 Tim. This stick was released as a thank you to everyone who followed and subscribed online during their early days in the business of cigars. This blend is a Nicaraguan Puro, which means it only uses tobaccos grown, cured, fermented, and rolled in the country of Nicaragua. It offers a medium bodied flavor profile with a subtle spice on the retrohale. Included in the blend of this Nicaraguan Puro, you’ll find flavor notes of Cedar, Nuts, and Earth.”"}
