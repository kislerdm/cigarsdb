It is a concept more than a cigar. Fine \u0026 Rare has been seen in many different formats since the project began. I play with different tobaccos and different crop years to create this 10 leaf masterpiece. I always need to let the blend dictate the size and shape of Fine \u0026 Rare in any given year. For 2021, Alec Bradley is proud to present 2500 boxes of the first iteration of Fine \u0026 Rare BC-(13)4EV. Celebrating the eleventh evolution of Fine \u0026 Rare, this collectors set contains 10 Churchill cigars and a very special 11th cigar to be revealed by enthusiasts upon box opening.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":81},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Katman","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":98}]}
