Flores 1975 Serie Privada Capa Habano SP52 might take the award for longest name ever to appear on our Top 25 list. The 1975 is for Flores's year of birth, the Capa Habano for the Cuban seed used for the wrapper. Flores makes his cigars in his factory in the Dominican Republic, and he has his workers construct cigars with mounted heads, a style of cigarmaking common to Cuba but seldom seen in the Dominican Republic.The construction on the cigar, with its sharp box press, is superb. The flavor is even better, balanced and very tasty, with pleasant hints of vanilla, coffee bean and cocoa.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
