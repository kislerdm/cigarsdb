It is now called the Aganorsa Leaf Aniversario Maduro. But rest assured the only thing that has changed is the name. It uses the same mouthwatering Aganorsa Leaf tobacco maduro wrapper, and Nicaraguan binder and filler. And it still offers the same flavor profile and strength that has made Aganorsa Leaf a globally recognized brand. The cigars are handmade in the small factory located in the companyâ€™s headquarters in Miami, Florida","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
