But for CAO, so accustomed to pushing the boundaries of flavor, this is where they discovered some of their best, and most unique, tobaccos. This particular tobaccos is grown in the Benevento region of Italy and offers an enjoyable sweetness backed ever so slightly by toasted earthiness. When combined with a luscious, dark Habano-seed wrapper leaf grown in Honduras, and a select blend of fine filler leave tobaccos from Nicaragua and Peru, you’ll find an intricate 4-country blend that’s incredibly rich, robust, and complex. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2008","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
