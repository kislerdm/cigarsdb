The secret behind this exquisite cigar is the dark, oily wrapper. Rolled with a super-rich, Ecuadorian-grown El Bajo sungrown leaf from the Oliva family’s farm, this cigar is almost as enjoyable to look at as it is to burn. A bold, full-flavored cigar that’s chock full of robust, satisfying flavors and luxuriously smooth from start to finish. A wonderful (but expensive) top-shelf premium.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
