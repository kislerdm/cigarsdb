This Underdog mentality is what fuels Dapper Cigar Co. in the cigar industry. For over two years they sample tested small batches of this cigar, in a large number of iterations, each time, receiving feedback from trusted palates. Dapper Cigar took this information to heart, went back to the blending table countlessly, worked with Raul Disla (NACSA) and the folks at Oliva Tobacco Company to source the correct tobaccos. Getting the high level of nicotine and strength without using under-fermented tobacco and still maintaining blend balance. The only way they could achieve this was through some interesting tobacco they never used before and some of which was relatively new."}
