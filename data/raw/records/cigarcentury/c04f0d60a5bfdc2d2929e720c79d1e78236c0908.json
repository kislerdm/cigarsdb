Borrowing inspiration from American muscle cars, Flathead not only sports a highly-unique shape, but backs it up with a high-octane blend. Instead of the traditional round or torpedo shaped head, this sleek handmade is completely squared off. CAO Flathead starts with a well-fermented Connecticut Broadleaf maduro wrapper. Thick and chewy, the leaf conceals a bevy of Nicaraguan and Dominican long-fillers embraced by a Connecticut Habano-seed binder. Then, each cigar is carefully box-pressed. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
