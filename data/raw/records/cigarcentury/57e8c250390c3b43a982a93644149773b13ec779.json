So many brands have come and gone, but these ageless Dominican beauties still find a good home in humidors everywhere. Why? Because Cuesta Rey Cabinet cigars are still made at the famed Tabacalera A. Fuente factory in the Dominican Republic with the same dedication to quality that smokers have come to rely on for many decades. Covered by your choice ofÂ a toasty and toothy Cameroon wrapper, or a darker Connecticut Broadleaf maduro, the cigars are packed with the finest aged Dominican binder and long fillers. Expect a mellow to medium bodied smoke with notes of coffee, cedar, spice, and cream from the Cameroon selection, and flavors of earth, chocolate, leather and pepper, while smoking the maduro."}
