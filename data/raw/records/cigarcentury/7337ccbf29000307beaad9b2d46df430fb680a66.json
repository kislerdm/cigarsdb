Sullivan in 1874 but later Kurt A. Kendall, an old school cigar enthusiast, acquired and re-launched it. Kurt Kendall's revived the 7-20-4 Cigars and devoted himself in making it one of the finest blend available in the market. He crafted those using long filler tobaccos from a variety of Latin American countries namely, Nicaragua, Honduras, Mexico and Columbia and a Costa Rican binder. These cigars come wrapped in a Brazilian Mata Fina wrapper hand picked by Kurt Kendall. As a result of all these combinations of long filler tobaccos 7-20-4 Cigars turned out to be a medium-bodied, smooth and flavorful cigar.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
