Sultry Nicaraguan wrappers are stretched over an amalgam of long-filler tobaccos from Columbia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and San Andr√©s. Medium to full-bodied notes of earth and cedar with toasted spices deliver oily, luscious flavors in a prolonged finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
