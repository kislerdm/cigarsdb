The Davidoff Dominicana is not a cigar you taste, it's a cigar you feel â€“ from the rhythms of Merengue to the local art blazing with bright and vivid colours straight into the very ground from where the tobacco sprang. The result is a carnival of flavours unfolding as you enjoy the cigar with aromas of fresh spices dancing with dried fruits."}
