Not familiar with the name? You most assuredly know his work. Originally known for his helm at the top of Drew Estate, Saka oversaw DE when they were hitting their boom with ACID cigars, and was a pivotal force in developing Liga Privada. Since then, \nToday, we welcome Sin Compromiso, a cigar that Saka has called the best one heâ€™s ever blended. Top Cigar of 2018 lists, utilizing a growing method inspired by Japanese fruit farmers, the fields Saka uses produce dramatically less yield than a normal tobacco field, but each leaf is absolute perfection. Joined by Ecuadorian binder and Nicaraguan long-filler, Sin Compromiso explodes with rich flavors of chocolate brownies, coffee, and a unique sweetness.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
