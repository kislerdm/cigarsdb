Experienced puffers and stogie thrill-seekers listen up, because this blend is only here to raise a ruckus for a limited time. Starting with an Ecuador Sumatra wrapper and Connecticut Broadleaf binder, this treat for the senses contains all Nicaraguan fillers, including a heavy portion of ligero to kick up the spice. But Delirium is much more than a powerhouse. Layers of complex spice and pepper lay a foundation and remain prominent throughout, but underneath, careful blending resulted in a delicious bouquet of roasted nuts, oak, nougat, leather, and a subtle natural sweetness. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Katman","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
