Blended with handpicked, aged long leaves, Gold reliably delivers a classic cigar experience, and comes handsomely packaged in great looking cedar chests. Don’t be fooled by the pristine Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper on CAO Gold, this cigar is not mellow. Weighing in at more of a medium-body, Gold’s exquisite wrapper is expertly applied atop of Cuban-seed Nicaraguan filler and binder.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
