The Ninfa had all but disappeared from being present in the U.S. market, but Crux rolled the dice and decided to introduce it as a part of their launch. Back in 2016, Crux also created a shop exclusive sampler for Stogies World Class Cigars in Houston Texas known as the Ninfamaniac Collection. Both the Ninfamaniac and Ninfamaniac Dark were included in that sampler. Dominant flavor is a very woody smoke flavor along with a bit leather and coffee. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
