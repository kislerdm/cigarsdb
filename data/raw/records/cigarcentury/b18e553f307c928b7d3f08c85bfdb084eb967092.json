The thieves used sledgehammers to break through the warehouse wall and take off with the goods. The La Mandarria (Spanish for sledgehammer) sports an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper that conceals a Nicaraguan binder, which houses fillers from Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. Handmade in the Dominican Republic, the La Mandarria is considered Casa Cuevas’ first full-bodied, full-strength cigar. A pigtail cap and shaggy foot give the La Mandarria a very stylish flair. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
