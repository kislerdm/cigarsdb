Born in Cuba and thoroughly in tune with the motherland, Santana has a knack for making the cigars the cigar makers love most. Ask anyone in South Florida who blends cigars, and they will tell you Santana made the best cigars until a few years ago when he went underground. \nHabano Aged 6 Years is the Habano version of the D’Crossier from the September box, NOT the Maduro version that was in that selection. These are some fine Dominican cigars aged professionally in cedar. This will be a great education on how cedar affects a cigar. You will taste the actual wood in this cigar. Not hints of it, or something that reminds you of cedar, but actual cedar."}
