These are the components used to craft Diesel Wicked. A full-bodied, full-flavored apparition formed by the hands of a master. The weak and timid need not apply - Wicked yields a bold assortment of deep nuances and spicy undertones. Oak, leather, dark tobacco, roasted espresso bean, black pepper, red pepper. "}
