Crowned Heads produced only 150,000 sticks (sold in 20-count boxes) of the Reserve XVIII so you might want to stock up on this limited edition while it’s still around. The Court Reserve XVIII is available in three vitolas: Corona Gorda, Robusto, and Sublime. Medium to full-bodied, the Court Reserve XVII features a Mexican San Andrés wrapper with a chocolatey and woodsy profile and hints of pepper.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":96}]}
