Originally made with Jamaican tobacco, today they offer two lines: the Honduran, softer, and the Nicaraguan, more robust. All La Invicta cigars are handmade from long-filled tobacco leaves and designed to suit the tastes of British smokers. Its name, \"La Invicta,\" reflects the strength and resilience of a brand that has stood the test of time."}
