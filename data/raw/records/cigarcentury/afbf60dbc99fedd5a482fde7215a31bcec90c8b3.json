While this cigar does utilizes tobacco from Nicaragua, it is just one of four different country's delicious tobacco recruited for this blend.Â At the heart of this complex blend lies filler tobacco from Nicaragua, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic that when combined with Honduran binder and draped in an Ecuadorian tobacco leaf delivers an unforgettable medium-full bodied profile. Sweet, spicy, oak, pepper, dried fruit, and cinnamon are just a few of the notes your senses will experience with this bold blend that delivers a delightfully balanced.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
