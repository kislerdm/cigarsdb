Dark, oily, and bursting with flavor, this prized leaf from the Jamastran province covers a Dominican Piloto binder and long-fillers from Nicaragua and Honduras. In true Cohiba fashion, each leaf in the blend has been aged for 5-6 years, smoothing any sharp edges while keeping the strength and spice intact, as well as heavy, full-bodied notes of espresso, earth, leather, and dried fruit.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
