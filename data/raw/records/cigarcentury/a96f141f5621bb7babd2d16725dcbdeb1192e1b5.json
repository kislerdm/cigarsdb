Inspired by the story of a man’s complex pursuit of truth, Wise Blood invites a reflective smoking experience, encouraging an attention to nuance and an appreciation of the harmony of a paradoxically balanced blend. This blend is described with Ecuadorian Habano Rosado HVA wrapper, Ecuadorian Connecticut binder and Nicaraguan fillers. Wise Blood is a mild-to-medium bodied, delicately balanced cigar, carrying sweet almond notes, with hints of lemon zest that delight the palate and reward a patient smoker. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
