In the pre-2019 classification system it was a niche brand. When first introduced, Cuaba was considered to be a premium \nAt the start Cuaba offered just comparatively small sizes. Divinos, Tradicionales, Generosos and Exclusivos. Since 2003, three much larger vitolas, Distinguido, Diadema and Salomón, have been released as part of the standard range."}
