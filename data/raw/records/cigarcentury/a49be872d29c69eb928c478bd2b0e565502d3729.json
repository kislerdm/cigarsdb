El Borracho Maduro stands on the shoulders of the original El Borracho San Andr√©s release. Using that original blend as a base, they have amped up the cigar's strength by adding slightly more Nicaraguan Ligero from Oliva Tobacco's prized La Joya farm and swapped the wrapper with a lush U.S. Connecticut Broadleaf. This new combination produces a robust smoking experience that'll satisfy even the most seasoned cigar smokers.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
