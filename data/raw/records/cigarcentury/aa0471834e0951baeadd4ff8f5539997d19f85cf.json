Often called \"red dot\" Cohibas due to the markings on the band, this exquisite cigar offers a medium-bodied flavor and a strong, smooth and incredibly rich character. Handmade with a toothy Cameroon wrapper and aged mixture of Dominican-grown Piloto Cubano tobaccos, Cohiba's blend sets the standard among today's premium cigars.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
