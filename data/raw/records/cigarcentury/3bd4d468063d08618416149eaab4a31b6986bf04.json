The NBK Robusto features an Ecuadorian Habano Oscuro wrapper and Nicaraguan binder with Nicaraguan fillers that are rolled at the Fabrica Oveja Negra factory. NBK (which stands for Natural Born Killer) is going to start out as a medium-bodied cigar for most of the smoke and then transitions to a fuller profile. You will get hints of rich chocolate, nut and pepper on the palate.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
