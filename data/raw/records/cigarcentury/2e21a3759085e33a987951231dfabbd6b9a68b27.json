Although Roly passed away in 2012, his passion and dedication to making premium cigars \nRoly began making cigars in Cuba at the age of nine but went on to impart a lifetime of knowledge in blending some of the greatest Honduran brands of the past thirty years. Puros Indios Vintage is crafted from the company’s oldest tobacco reserves to achieve an ultra-refined taste. A glistening, gingerbread-hued Ecuador wrapper envelops a hearty blend of Dominican, Nicaraguan, and Brazilian long-fillers concealed in a smooth and succulent binder cultivated in Ecuador. Toasty and woody notes of cedar, hickory, and leather coat the palate with peppery texture while abundant aroma fills the room. "}
