Although the name has been shortened, the flavorful blend contained within is simply HUGE. Featuring a pristine Nicaraguan Habano wrapper and premium Nicaraguan binder and filler, this medium to full-bodied puro is the love child of three of the most respected names found in tobacco.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Snob","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
