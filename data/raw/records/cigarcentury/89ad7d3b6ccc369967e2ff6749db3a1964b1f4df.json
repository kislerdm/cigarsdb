Handcrafted at Tavicusa S.A. in Esteli, the 601 White is seamlessly rolled in an attractive, milder tasting Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper that caps a heartier core of Nicaraguan Estel√≠ and Jalapa tobaccos. Expect a smoke that starts out spicy yet finishes smooth and creamy with a enough complexity to keep it interesting.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
