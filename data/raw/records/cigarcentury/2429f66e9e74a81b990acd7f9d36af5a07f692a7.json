After a long period of inactivity, Nodal relaunched the brand as Oliveros Gran Retorno in collaboration with Plasencia Cigars in Nicaragua. These cigars undergo an exclusive aging process that can last up to 33 months, allowing them to develop a splendid flavor and aroma. The range includes varieties such as Oliveros Gran Retorno Shade, Oliveros Gran Retorno Habano and Oliveros Gran Retorno Maduro, each offering a unique experience with distinctive notes ranging from coffee and cocoa to spices and leather."}
