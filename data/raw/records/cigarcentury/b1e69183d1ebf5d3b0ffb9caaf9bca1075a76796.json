That organization is El Aposento, a social services project in Tamboril that provides education, social work, youth group programs, voluntary cleaning of neighborhoods, sports programs, and other services to the area, with a focus on the children of cigar manufacturers. Launched in 2015 by Kerlyn Peña and Gabriella Mejia Peña, the charity also works with a local optician, Dr. Marylin Paez, to bring eyeglasses to children in the area whose families can not afford the cost of about $30 per pair."}
