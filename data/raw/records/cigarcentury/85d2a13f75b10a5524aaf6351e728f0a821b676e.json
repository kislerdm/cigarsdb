They’re smooth, sleek, and delicious - and with just enough Nicaraguan oomph. This limited-release cigar utilizes a rare Esteli-grown Engañoso leaf over a hearty Connecticut Broadleaf binder and five select tobaccos from Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. The taste is rich, leading the way with notes of cocoa, raisins, and white pepper for a lavish smoking experience.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
