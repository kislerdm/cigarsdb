This long-standing tradition for 5 Vegas features a one-off, small-batch production, so while the blends and product used to craft these cigars can differ, an overall theme runs through each. Here, let’s take a look at the 2019 and 2020 versions. The cigars from 2019 utilize high-primed Dominican and Nicaraguan long-fillers. This feisty blend rests snug in a Cameroon binder. A hearty Nicaraguan leaf wraps it all together. You’re left with a medium-strength smoke that will engulf your palate with flavors of coffee, cedar, pepper, and wood."}
