It is easily lit, with a gentle light-up. The herbaceous aromas embellish the first puffs, as they soon open and assert a hardened flavor with cedar and bark-planted tips. The strength arises to a crescendo, gaining depth, density, and strength, particularly at the end. A voluptuous and invigorating model for connoisseurs."}
