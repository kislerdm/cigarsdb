Though Brazilia performs well in every size, most notable here are the 54 to 60-ring options. The complexity offered from these wider vitolas keeps the cigars smooth, burning cool all the way down to the nub. In short, Brazilia is a classic blend, well worth your consideration.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2009","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2003","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2002","ratingOutOf100":84}]}
