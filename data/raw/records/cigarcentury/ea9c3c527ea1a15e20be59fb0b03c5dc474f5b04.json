This ensures a one-of-a-kind, exclusive, and rare product that you simply won’t find in too many places. Scarcity breeds demand, and when you couple that fact with the undeniable tastiness of the cigars themselves, you have a real winner on your hands. Aging Room Havao opens with a gorgeous, Connecticut Ecuadorian wrapper leaf that delivers plenty of peppery notes of spice and an underlying creamy character. The filler blend also contributes generously to the overall experience, with Dominican-grown Habano criollo. The burn is long and cool, and a careful construction guarantees a perfect draw.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
