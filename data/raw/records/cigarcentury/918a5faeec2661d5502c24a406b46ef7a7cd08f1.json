Before its release, few believed the Dominican Republic could grow quality wrapper tobacco, but the Fuentes planted Cuban seeds, grew them under shade, and ended up with gorgeous, reddish-brown tobacco full of power and character. That wrapper leaf became the defining component of the Fuente Fuente OpusX, dark and gutsy cigars with notes of red pepper and leather.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
