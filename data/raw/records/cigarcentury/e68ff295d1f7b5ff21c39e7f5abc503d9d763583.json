As a special brand (including Cuaba and Trinidad Cuban Cigars), its worldwide reputation and historic recalls have made it one of the most respected brands around. Maybe it would be unfair to claim that all the best cigars have been produced by Habanos, but a box of San Cristobal de la Habana brings with it a special charm that ensures they are always considered when people are naming the best brands in the cigar industry."}
