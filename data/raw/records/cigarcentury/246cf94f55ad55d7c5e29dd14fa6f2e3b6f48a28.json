Finally releasing at the 2017 IPCPR trade show, Senor Esugars is named after founder Stephen Bailey’s pet Daschund, or as Stephen Bailey calls him, his sidekick.  Handmade at the La Zona factory in Esteli, Nicaragua, Senor Esugars features a Mexican San Andres wrapper leaf overtop US binder and Nicaraguan long-filler tobaccos. The blend is powerful and flavorful, weighing in at a medium to full-body, and dishing out notes of black pepper, berry-like sweetness, and a lot of red pepper spice."}
