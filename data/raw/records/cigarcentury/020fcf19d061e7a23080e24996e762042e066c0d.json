Thus, the Alpha Defuser cigar was born. To create a unique flavor for their Alpha Defuser Claro, the Alpha Cigar Company aged the tobacco in oak wine barrels for three months. The Alpha Defuser Claro features a light-brown Mexican San Andres wrapper that envelopes an Olor Dominicano binder and a filler made of Cuban-seed Piloto Cubano leaves to create a medium-bodied cigar. The Alpha Defuser Claro has a well-balanced flavor profile that is earthy, nutty, spicy and with a hint of wine."}
