The Crow’s dark, sweet Mexican San Andres maduro wrapper cloaks a Dominican binder, which houses premium Nicaraguan and USA Pennsylvania fillers. The Blackbird’s solid construction creates a smooth draw that allows its complex flavors of spice, chocolate, and tobacco to come through.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Public","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
