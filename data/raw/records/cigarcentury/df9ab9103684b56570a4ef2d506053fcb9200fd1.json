Brown’s mindset was to keep his blends exciting but his portfolio small. Within each line only a few sizes are made. His mentality is that you do not need more than 3 vitolas everything else is a waste of resources. This boutique company has made waves in the industry over the years. The Bishops Blend features an Ecuadorian habano maduro wrapper, Ecuadorian habano binder, and fillers from Nicaragua and Connecticut, as well as Pennsylvania-grown broadleaf. It is made at Fabrica Oveja Negra in Estelí, Nicaragua."}
