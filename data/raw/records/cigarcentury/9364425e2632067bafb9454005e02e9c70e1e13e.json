This cigar takes its place in the Master Built series, alongside the Triple Maduro and the full-bodied American Barrel Aged. Powerband isn’t just flashy to look at though, it’s a masterclass performer under the hood. Rolled with a unique bunching process that makes sure there’s a great draw on every cigar, Powerband is everything you want in a premium cigar. Tobacco from five different countries shows off notes of dark coffee, chili pepper, and a rich oaky core with an Ecuadorian Habano 2000 wrapper bringing an extra bit of oomph to this one.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
