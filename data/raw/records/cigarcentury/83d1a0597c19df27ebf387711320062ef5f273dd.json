FUGLY is free-hand rolled on a flat table in the traditional style without binder and filled with only long leaf tobaccos. Select either a toothy Mexican San Andres wrapper or a Dominican Corojo Claro. Maduro comes with powerful pepper punch with citrus on the retrohale and woody notes. Claro with cedar and spice and a fair bit of hay."}
