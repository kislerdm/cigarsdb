Sporting a shaggy foot, the flavors of the binder and filler tobaccos become highlighted at first puff before the flame reaches the wrapper, “unleashing” the character of the Corojo cover leaf. In doing this, Camacho wanted this blend to represent the full potential and innovation of their Camacho factory and the plan is to continue that representation as the sole focus with each new annual release. A medium to full-bodied profile will offer notes of leather, earth, wood, cocoa, and pepper. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
