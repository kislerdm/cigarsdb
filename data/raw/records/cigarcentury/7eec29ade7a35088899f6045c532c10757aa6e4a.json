These are the names Alec Bradley Cigar Company’s founder, Alan Rubin, two sons. When Alan Rubin first started the company, they were just kids. But over the past 20 years, they have grown up in the business, learned the heritage, the tradition, techniques, and found a love for tobacco on their own. Alec \u0026 Bradley Blind Faith is the first blend they have created on their own. It starts out with a deep brown Habano wrapper grown in Trojes, Honduras. Underneath is a double binder combination from Honduras and Nicaragua that creates a sturdy, slow burning cigar. The meat is a three-leaf combination or Nicaraguan long-fillers. Medium to full-bodied, Blind Faith provides an evolving cadence of personality. A strong spicy note off the bat gives way to flavors of pepper, nuttiness, and earthiness. "}
