Newman’s vintage brands made by our founder, J.C. Newman, back in 1914. This nickel cigar was originally hand rolled in a Cleveland, Ohio factory with Cuban tobacco. Although it was popular for many years, the onset of machine-made cigars caused El Baton to disappear from \nIn 2008, J.C.’s grandsons, Eric and Bobby Newman, re-launched the brand as the company’s first Nicaraguan cigar. El Baton cigars are grown in the most fertile areas of Nicaragua, providing for a smooth, hearty smoke with a little spice. When it debuted, El Baton was only offered in one size, the Double Torpedo, since then the brand has grown to include three more sizes, a Double Toro, Robusto and Belicoso. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2010","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2009","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
