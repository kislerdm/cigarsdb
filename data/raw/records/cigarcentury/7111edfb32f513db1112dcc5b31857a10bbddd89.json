Rocky’s prolific output and sincere penchant for perfection occasionally result in a cigar release that simply doesn’t fit into the esteemed Rocky Patel portfolio. To accommodate Rocky’s relentless blending endeavors, the Rocky Patel Mulligans franchise was developed as a channel to bring many of Rocky’s lesser-known, but equally prized cigars to market.
