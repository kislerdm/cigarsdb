Made entirely of Cuban seed tobacco grown in the Dominican Republic, the F55 is a small-batch boutique handmade from skilled brand owner Rafael Nodal and Tabacalera La Palma cigar maker Jochi Blanco. The Aging Room Quattro cigars are small batch cigars made with a unique tobacco blend and constructed with superbly aged Sumatra wrappers  that, quite honestly, are the component which defines the flavor and enhances the savory Havana-seed Dominican fillers and binders. Not as sweet  as the original Aging Room cigars, the Quattros are on the meatier side, with earth, leather, cedar, and a smoky, nutty creaminess.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
