Especially with how well-loved the Ave Maria blends are to CI Nation. This potent Nicaraguan puro could be the strongest Ave blend yet. Loaded with a hefty dose of well-aged, flavorful long-filler tobaccos, Dark Knight is cloaked inside a dark Nicaraguan maduro wrapper. Upon lighting, you get notes of spice and leather up front, that finishes with a smooth, rich dark chocolate note. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Katman","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
