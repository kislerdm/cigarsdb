Consisting of just 3 sizes and manufactured in Nicaragua, 1874 is well-constructed from a savory blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers that produce a medium-body with smooth notes of pepper and leather. A supple, medium-brown Nicaraguan wrapper was chosen for its visual appeal as well as it’s earthy-peppery spice. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":81},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
