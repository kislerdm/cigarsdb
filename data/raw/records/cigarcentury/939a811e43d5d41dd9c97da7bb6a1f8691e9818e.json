Recently the company has expanded its portfolio, exporting its tobacco leaves, working with blenders from other factories and creating new cigars made from a variety of types of tobaccos. The A. Turrent Triple Play Belicoso is made with a combination of maduro tobaccos from Mexico, Honduras and Connecticut, and the resulting mix (which involves blending several vintages) is sublime. The Triple Play Belicoso smacks of espresso bean and cedar."}
