Each year the company has released a different blend with different packaging. 2019 was no exception as the company released \nThe name “The Angel’s Anvil” is derived from a story of a fallen angel who seeks to find his way back to heaven. During this time, the outcast angel finds a blacksmith who provides him with a hammer and anvil – the tools that can be used to rebuild his wings. The Angel’s Anvil, Crowned Heads teams up with long-time partner Ernesto Perez Carrillo Jr. at Tabacalera La Alianza to produce the 2019 edition. While it’s a familiar factory, it’s a cigar with a wrapper that has not been used in a Crowned Heads release at all – Brazilian Arapiraca. The remainder of the blend uses an Ecuadorian Sumatra binder and Nicaraguan fillers.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
