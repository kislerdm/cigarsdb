Nestled in the Cibao region of Dominican Republic the third-generation family-owned factory known as Tabacalera El Artista (TEA) has been growing tobacco and rolling cigars for nearly 65 years. TEA is a massive operation: 3,500 acres of tobacco on more than 60 farms in Dominican Republic and Ecuador. Additionally, the company owns several warehouses, five tobacco sorting and fermentation facilities, and one cigar factory in Tamb√≥ril, DR. Even though TEA is a top producer in the Caribbean, cigar consumers in the US are forgiven for not knowing them as a juggernaut in the industry."}
