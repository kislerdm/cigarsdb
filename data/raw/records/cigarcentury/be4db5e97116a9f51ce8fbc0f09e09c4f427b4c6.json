What makes Las Calaveras cigars particularly appealing is the fact that they’re blended and manufactured by master cigar-maker Jose ‘Pepin’ Garcia at his esteemed My Father Cigars factory in Estelí, Nicaragua. The Edicion Limitada 2022 is handcrafted from a robust blend of premium Nicaraguan long-fillers tucked inside an oily, reddish-brown Nicaraguan Corojo ’99 wrapper leaf in a collection of classic sizes. The 2022 edition marks the first time the annual Las Calaveras release is blended entirely from Nicaraguan tobaccos. Tasting notes of leather, earth, pepper, and wood culminate before a deep, medium to full-bodied finish leaves its impression on the palate.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
