Along with its gargantuan size comes with enormous flavor. A bevy of Nicaraguan, Honduran, and Costa Rican long-fillers plump up this monster before it’s all secured by a gleaming Nicaraguan wrapper leaf. A rich and spicy profile is supported by notes of citrus, leather, and nuts to create a delicious, medium-bodied profile."}
