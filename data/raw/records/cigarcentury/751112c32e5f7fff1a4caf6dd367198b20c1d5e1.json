Just check out the F55 Concerto – it wasn’t long ago that this 95-rated cigar was the highest-rated, non-Cuban blend of the year. Since then, the brand has grown and expanded, but has always kept its core idea the same: offering up a bevy of boutique blends that combine consistency with complexity and premium aged tobaccos. Today, we’re looking at Aging Room’s newest release, the Pura Cepa. A 100% Nicaraguan puro, Aging Room Pura Cepa featured an oily Habano wrapper leaf over a perfect blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers from Ometepe, Jalapa, Esteli and Condega. Crafted by Rafael Nodal and produced at the renowned Nestor Plasencia factory in Esteli, Pura Cepa delivers an overtly rich profile that delivers perfect harmony on every puff.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Snob","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Katman","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
