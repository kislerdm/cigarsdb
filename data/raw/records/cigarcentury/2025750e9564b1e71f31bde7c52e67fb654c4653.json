It took 12 years before \n“She was the flower that rises from cracked pavement, the beauty that survives brokenness, the redemption that overcomes tragedy. This cigar echoes the life of a complex woman who reminds us that even when all odds are against us, we nevertheless have the capacity to hold onto the light.”","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
