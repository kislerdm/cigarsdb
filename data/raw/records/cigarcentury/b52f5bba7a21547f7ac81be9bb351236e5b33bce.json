This medium to full-bodied Nicaraguan treat is an homage to Janny Garcia, daughter of 'Pepin' Garcia and sister to Jaime, all three of which run the My Father company. Featuring notes of earth, leather and pepper, La Duena reminds us that a cigar blend is nothing without a great team behind it.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
