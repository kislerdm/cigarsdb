After spending years creating highly rated blends under the Camacho name. Known for use of authentic corojo tobacco, the Eiroa family are masters in creating the perfect blends. As an Authentic Honduran Corojo Puro, Eiroa Dark Natural uses a higher priming of corojo tobacco, and its exposure to more sun, for its \"dark\" wrapper. But don't let that discourage you! Rich and full-bodied, this cigar is filled with notes of oak, leather, almonds, and baking spices that dance across your palate from start to finish. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
