Now enter the next chapter in the Oval saga, the Oval Maduro. Picking up right where Oval left off, the Oval Maduro uses the same exquisite fillers, and binder, but now comes draped in an enticing Connecticut Broadleaf maduro. This dark leaf shimmers with oily goodness, and conceals the Ovalâ€™s balanced and refined core of Nicaraguan and Honduran long-fillers. This time around, expect an uber-smooth and balanced profile, containing more predominant notes of coffee bean, leather, cocoa and pepper backed by a long and hearty finish."}
