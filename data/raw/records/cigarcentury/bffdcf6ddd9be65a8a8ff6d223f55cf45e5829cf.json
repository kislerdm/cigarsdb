More specifically, though, they started around 1815 in Florence, Italy, producing cigars that were made of Kentucky leaf. They started cultivating tobacco in Italy around 1850, taking over 50 years \nThe Toscano Classico had lots of wood smoke flavor (naturally), but there was a definite sweetness in the mix that defied exact characterization, along with a healthy amount of earth and a mild pepper spice on the palate.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
