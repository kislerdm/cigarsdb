From flavor, complexity, construction, and smoke output this AFC offering is definitely something special. Offered in a firm boxed pressed 6x54 toro and cloaked in a Dark Nicaraguan Oscuro wrapper,  this medium-full/full bodied cigar offers rich bold flavors such as aged leather, cashew, cinnamon and spice on the front end with nuances of milk chocolate, graham, coffee and wood notes on the finish/retro. "}
