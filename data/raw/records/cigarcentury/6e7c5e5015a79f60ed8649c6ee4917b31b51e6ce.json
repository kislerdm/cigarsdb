While out to dinner one night, former musician Avo Uvezian became irate over the price he had to pay for a Cuban cigar. He decided to take matters into his own hands and, along with famed cigar-craftsman Hendrik Kelner, created an original line made from only the finest tobacco. The AVO Classic cigar is a beautifully constructed piece from the very finest premium leaves, including a silky Connecticut shade wrapper and Dominican long-filler leaves. The result is a creamy, smooth taste and wonderful aroma. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2025","ratingOutOf100":90.1},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2009","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2004","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
