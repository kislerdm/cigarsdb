Back then, the company was known as Tropical Tobacco, but that name was eventually changed to Casa Fernandez, which it used until 2018 when the company rebranded as Aganorsa Leaf. The AGANORSA in the name stands for Agricola Norteña S.A., an entity owned by Eduardo Fernández Pujals, that includes livestock, tobacco growing and cigar rolling. No matter what you call it, one of the company’s most popular releases has been Supreme Leaf, which debuted in January 2020 ate the Tabacco Plus Expo 2020 Trade Show in a single 5 X 52 box-pressed robusto vitola.  A second size was added to the line in July 2020 in size 5 X 54 Toro, but it took another seven months for the third vitola to appear, specifically a 6 x 46 corona gorda that shipped in February 2021.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Katman","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
