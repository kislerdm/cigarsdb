Handcrafted in Nicaragua, Paradiso showcases the marvelous blending ability of Pepin Garcia combined with Ashton's infinite commitment to quality. Purely Nicaraguan in composition, Paradiso offers profound complexity in every puff. Bold earthy and cedary flavors swim hand in hand with subtle, creamier flavors while a peppery spice and dark chocolaty sweetness alternate on the backend."}
