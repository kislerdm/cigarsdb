This is a rich and full-bodied blend topped in a dark, oily San Andres Maduro wrapper. The real treat comes on the inside, however, where a gorgeous blend of rare Nicaraguan Criollo ’98, Connecticut Broadleaf, and Dominican filler leaves impart plenty of flavor. The overall character is rich, creamy, and delightful. With a limited release of just 500 boxes per year, and available in your choice of three sizes."}
