Drawing on his Indian roots, Shal uses Sanskrit terms to name his cigars’ vitola and lines. His intricately designed bands and cigar boxes are also inspired by his home country’s heritage. Beautifully handmade in Costa Rica, MBombay cigars are known for adhering to traditional Cuban rolling methods, excellent construction, wonderful aroma and taste."}
