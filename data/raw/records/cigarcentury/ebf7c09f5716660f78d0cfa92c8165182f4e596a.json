Today, Manuel's daughters, nieces and nephews are now involved in the business, which changed its name to Quesada Cigars in 2014, the same year it released its Quesada 40th Anniversary cigar. The company also owns and produces the non-Cuban version of Fonseca and the award-winning Casa Magna brand, as well as a slew of third-party brands."}
