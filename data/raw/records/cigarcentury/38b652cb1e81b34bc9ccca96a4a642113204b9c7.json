A representative from Drew Estate did not respond to multiple messages seeking clarification about whether these two cigars are the same blend in function, or just on paper. For what it’s worth, the original ACID 20 blend uses a Mexican San Andrés wrapper over an Indonesian binder and Nicaraguan fillers.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
