Brands such as Metropolitan and Host were created in \nBut then, in 2011, the Shermans rejuvinated their cigar business with a brand called Nat Sherman Timeless that appealed to the modern cigar smoker's palate. It madeÂ Cigar Aficionado's Top 25 of 2012 list, and would go on to become a top seller for the company.
