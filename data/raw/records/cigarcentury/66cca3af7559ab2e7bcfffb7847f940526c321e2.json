The Costa Rican maduro wrapper found on 5 Vegas Series 'A' has been compared to the dark Medio Tiempo wrapper found on the famous Partagas Black Label. This robust cigar is big on flavor and light on the wallet, making it perfect for the everyday enthusiast and novice alike. It provides the perfect balance between body and flavor and will last right down to the nub. The complexity of this medium to full-bodied blend comes from its three-country filler, which has been aged for four years to give it a perfect balance."}
