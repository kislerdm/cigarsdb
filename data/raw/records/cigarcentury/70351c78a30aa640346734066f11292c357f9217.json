An oily Brazilian Arapiraca Maduro wrapper houses a blend of premium Nicaraguan long-fillers and a Nicaraguan binder. The bold, full-bodied flavor profile is punctuated by notes of cocoa and sweetness. Slow-burning, firm in hand, and deliciously tasty, itâ€™s a fitting follow-up that will easily work its way onto your top ten list.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
