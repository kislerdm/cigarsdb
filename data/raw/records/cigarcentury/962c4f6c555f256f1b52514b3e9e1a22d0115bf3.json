Growing up in West Tampa, in the shadow of the once-bustling cigar factories, taught Rick the value of hard work and instilled in him grit and determination. His grandparent’s stories of Havana and Cuban cigars in their heyday were never far from Rick’s mind. So, when the opportunity to work in the cigar business knocked, Rick was quick to answer. He soon found himself studying at the right hand of industry legends, most notably Benji Menendez who freely transferred his knowledge to Rick. Decades later, Rick has been recognized as a cigar master in his own right.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":90.3},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Katman","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":65}]}
