Only by holding one in your hand will you truly appreciate the magnitude of whatâ€™s been accomplished. By now, it is no secret that the Ave portfolio is ripe with some of the most enticing blends on the planet. Now, with the release of Ave Maria Divinia, a new standard has been set. With this offering, a lush, Habano Sun Grown wrapper encases a bold, ultra-refined core of Cuban-seed long-fillers. A Cuban-esque flavor profile dominated by notes of black pepper, cocoa, coffee, earth, and nutty sweetness, is delivered in a silky medium to full-bodied profile."}
