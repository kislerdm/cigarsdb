The blend consists of a stunning top-shelf Mexican San Andres wrapper that boasts a dark brown color and has an oily sheen, covering a core of aged Nicaraguan long fillers and a spicy Nicaraguan Habano binder. A closed foot and a rabito cap are applied to give the cigar an old-world Cuban style charm and to display their top-notch construction. Simply put, these cigars are full-bodied flavor bombs that are loaded with hearty flavors of pepper, caramel, oak, spice, cocoa and raisins. The burn is impressively slow and even, and the sweet, slightly smoky vanilla aroma was delightful, and they remain highly complex right down to the nub."}
