Thus, the Alpha Defuser cigar was born. The Alpha Defuser Maduro features a dark, sweet San Andres Maduro wrapper that surrounds an Olor Dominicano binder and a filler made of Cuban-seed Piloto Cubano leaves to create a mild to medium-bodied cigar. The Alpha Defuser Maduro has an earthy and spicy flavor profile with hints of sweetness."}
