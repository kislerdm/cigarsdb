At the 2013 IPCPR Trade Show, they unveiled the Curivari Achilles, which was blended to be stronger and fuller-bodied than other Curivari cigars. Like other Curivari's, the Achilles is a Nicaraguan puro, with a milk chocolate-colored Nicaraguan wrapper. These hidden gems feature medium to full-bodied smoke with a long, lingering finish and flavors of pepper, cedar and caramel."}
