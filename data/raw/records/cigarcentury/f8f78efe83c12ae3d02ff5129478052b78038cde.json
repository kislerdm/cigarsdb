He also mixed in more than a few stories about his life as a young man in Cuba, and our conversations transported me back to a very special time when pride and devotion to craftsmanship truly meant something.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":83},{"who":"Katman","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":97}]}
