And without a doubt, one of its highlights is Headley Grange. A smooth Ecuador Sumatra wrapper embraces rich, bold Nicaraguan long-fillers. Then, each cigar is gently box-pressed for a stunning presentation. The profile is medium to full-bodied emitting a buttery smooth nutty sweetness, that fuses nicely with coffee, nutmeg, and leather.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
