But when an ultra-boutique cigar company makes cigars this good, your name will get around quickly. The Curivari Reserva Limitada Cafe is a medium to full-bodied, all Nicaraguan cigar is blended with authentic Cuban seed Criollo and Corojo tobaccos, including the beautiful and rich Nicaraguan wrapper. A perfect smoke with a fine cup of coffee, the Limitada Cafe is loaded with lots of dark tobacco, coffee and cocoa undertones.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":84}]}
