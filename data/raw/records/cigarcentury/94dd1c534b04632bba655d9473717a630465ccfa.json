The brand has been an outstanding success with cigar connoisseurs for its superb quality, combined with setting new and innovative standards in the industry. Then, in 2007, ST Cigar Group Holding \nCAO Cigars have been all over the world, procuring some of the finest and rarest leaf known to man: the jungles of the Amazon, the mountains of Colombia the valleys of the Dominican Republic and the volcanoes of Nicaragua, and nearly every point on the map in between.The brand is known for its flashy packaging, experimenting with tobaccos from around the world, and creating new and unusual shapes like its popular and ultra-thick box-pressed Flathead brand.  CAO cigars have established themselves as one of the world’s most innovative cigar brands by creatively using the finest premium tobaccos from all over the world to create a smoke that is truly unlike any other. The Amazon Basin, Columbia, and Brazilia lines are fine examples of the rare and exquisite tobaccos used on many CAO blends.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
