Now before you think I’m trying to pull a fast one on you: Camacho Coyolar isn’t technically “new.” Originally grown on a 15-acre farm at the base of the mountain that joins Nicaragua and Honduras, Coyolar was on the market for years before mysteriously disappearing. But now, we can all rejoice, as Coyolar has made its triumphant return, sporting the same exact blend as the original. It may have a new coat of paint, but this one’s a tried and true blend — rich, bold, and incredibly full-bodied, Coyolar delivers heaping doses of oak, leather, and bitter espresso. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
