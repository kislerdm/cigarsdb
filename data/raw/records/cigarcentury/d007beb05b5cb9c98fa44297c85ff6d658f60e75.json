It is a medium strength cigar that features a Cameroon-seed wrapper that was grown in the Jamastran Valley in Honduras.

Once lit, the Aladino Cameroon delivers warm notes of spice with an underlying sweetness and creaminess.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Public","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":79},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":95}]}
