This vintage leaf is spun lovingly around a blend of long-filler tobaccos hailing from Nicaragua's premier growing regions of Esteli, Condega, and Ometepe. This complex core is then concealed by a rich Jalapa binder, kicking the level of complexity up another notch. Thick, billowing clouds of smoke greet the senses as this slow-burning cigar delivers all the way down to the nub. The best of what Nicaragua has to offer went into this one. And with a name like Davidoff behind it, it should come as no surprise.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Cigar Snob","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Snob","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
