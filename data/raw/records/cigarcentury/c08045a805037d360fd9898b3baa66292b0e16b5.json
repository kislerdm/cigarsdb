This leaf imparts a heartier, spicier, and overall richer character, while retaining the smooth balanced core that made the American Classic so enjoyable. Medium to full in body, the Sun Grown is complex yet smooth, and dishes out notes of black pepper, cedar, and nuts with a slight sweetness occasionally entering the fray.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
