This line extension to Robert Caldwell’s Long Live the King cigars, swaps out the original Dominican wrapper, binder, and fillers, for AJ’s signature blend of estate grown Nicaraguan tobacco. These top-shelf Nicaraguan puros are covered by a stunning oily wrapper and reward the palate with rich full-bodied notes of earth, toast, anise, espresso, and black pepper."}
