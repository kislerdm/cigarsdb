The Maduro version is very different from the regular Asylum Schizo line. Rather than being a Nicaraguan Puro like the original, Asylum Schizo Maduro is made in Eiroa’s Honduran factory using a filler blend of Honduran tobaccos and a dark San Andres Maduro wrapper. The change in the blend, as well as the Maduro wrapper, add to the body and flavor. Clocking in at a medium body, there are hints of cocoa and earth from the moment you light this cigar up until you are ready to put the nub down. "}
