That’s a true story. But when he wasn’t kicking ass and taking names, he spent a good amount of time living peacefully in Nashville under the alias “Howard.... J.D. Howard.\" This inventive \nJ.D. Howard Reserve is the third core line from Crowned Heads LLC, and is a fitting follow up to the Four Kicks and Headley Grange lines. Featuring an ultra-dark and toothy Brazilian Arapiraca wrapper, Ecuadorian Sumatra binder, and hand-selected long-fillers from Nicaragua, there's plenty of flavor in-store. Notes of wood, spice and coffee are present throughout a medium to full-bodied profile that's hard to resist.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
