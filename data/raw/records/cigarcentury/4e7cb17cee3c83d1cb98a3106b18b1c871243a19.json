That’s why when I heard that they were finally going to release a cigar with a Connecticut wrapper. The blend for this cigar is, in a word, impressive. Inside, a veritable feast of Brazilian Mata Fina, Dominican Olor, Dominican Piloto Cubana, and Nicaraguan Jalapa fillers dancing beneath a rich, flavorful Mexican San Andres binder. But let’s be honest, it’s the wrapper that caught your eye, and for good reason. This beautiful blonde leaf is from Ecuador’s Los Rios province, and grown beneath natural cloud cover yielding a beautiful golden color and almost imperceptible veins. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
