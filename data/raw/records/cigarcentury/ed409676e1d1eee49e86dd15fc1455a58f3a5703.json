This lineup was started with the initial release of the Mortal Coil and continued with the addition of the CAO Arcana Firewalker. The process to create these handmades is unique and almost a lost \nThe CAO Firewalker features a fermentation process that is unique to western Nicaragua. This process is called chincagre and includes the burying of piles of the Nicaraguan long-filler in the warm volcanic soil for two months and then undergoes a second fermentation at the factory for nine months. Chincagre helps to lock in the deep and mature sweet flavors of the leaves through natural fermentation and limited exposure to oxygen. These fillers are then paired with a Nicaraguan binder and an Ecuadorian Habano Rosado wrapper, which helps give the cigar a medium-full profile. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Daily","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":85},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":84}]}
