No exaggeration. Grand Cru celebrates the heritage of this highly prestigious line, honoring the original blends and sizes made by Zino Davidoff. Grand Cru is a cigar that immediately impresses. Gazing upon this fine specimen, you’ll note the seamless, smooth Ecuadorian-grown Connecticut wrapper leaf, and the timeless Davidoff artwork. Most importantly, lighting it up, you’ll find a bouquet of complexity that only Davidoff can provide. Buttery and nutty in the beginning, Grand Cru develops subtle spice, cedar, and that signature Davidoff “grassiness” as it burns. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2003","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
