The Saint Francis Colorado is a follow up to the original Saint Francis release, which was our Cigar of the Year in 2021. Made at Rocky' Patel's TAVICUSA factory the cigar utilizes the same binder and fuller as the original release, however the wrapper is swapped out for a Ecuador Habano Colorado that is smooth to the touch. The result is a cigar that has a lower perceived strength profile.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
