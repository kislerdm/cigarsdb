The strength is medium; note that this is one of the few brands which is only handmade. Developed by Jose Rocha and Rafael Garcia, the brand got off to a good start thanks to tireless promotion by Pepin Fernandez, owner of the Romeo y Julieta brand, who helped his friends introduce the La Gloria Cubana and El Crepusculo brands overseas.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":83},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
