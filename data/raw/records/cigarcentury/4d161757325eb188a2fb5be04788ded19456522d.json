The blend begins with a vintage ’99 Jamastran Corojo wrapper draped around a complex filler blend including a significant portion of authentic pre-embargo Cuban tobacco - the very same tobaccos used in Camacho’s beloved Liberty series. Medium in body with a rich flavor profile, Camacho’s 1962 Pre-Embargo size brings copious amounts of flavor, including wood, leather, nuts, and spices."}
