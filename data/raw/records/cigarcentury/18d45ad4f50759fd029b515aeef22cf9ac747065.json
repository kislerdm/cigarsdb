His inspiration for the 'Copper Label' (this blend's former name) was a fusion of ACID, Natural, and traditional blends....and he nailed it. CI Legends by Drew Estate easily stands among the best infused cigars \nHugged by a beautiful Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper, this stunning handmade combines bold Nicaraguan long-fillers with a leaf of Dominican Piloto. These lush tobaccos have been carefully influenced by the delicious nuances of amaretto and hazelnut, completing a savory experience. After a sweet start, it coats the palate with loads of creamy flavor, offering a rich core of coffee flavors complemented by notes of hazelnut and pepper. Mellow to medium-bodied and oh-so-enjoyable."}
