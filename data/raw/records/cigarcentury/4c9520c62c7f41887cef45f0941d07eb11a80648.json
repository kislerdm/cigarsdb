Coming from the Caldwell Cigar Company, which has relatively recently been founded in 2014 and quickly garnered intense fame, The King Is Dead cigar is one of the best Dominican puros I have ever smoked. These top-shelf gems are blended with expertly aged Dominican Corojo and Habano long filler tobaccos that are stuffed inside a Dominican Corojo binder and completed with a top-quality and rare Dominican Negrito wrapper leaf. The resulting smoke is a medium-full bodied, providing the palate with balanced and bold notes of spice, chocolate, dark roast coffee, earth, cedar, and a sweet molasses finish"}
