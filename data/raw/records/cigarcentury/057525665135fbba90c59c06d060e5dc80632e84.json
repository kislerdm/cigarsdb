A gorgeous, rich and oily Ecuadorian Habano tops off this little stunner. A cornucopia of complex flavors awaits you here, with notes of spice, nuts, and cream making their debuts during the creamy, oh-so-smooth experience.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
