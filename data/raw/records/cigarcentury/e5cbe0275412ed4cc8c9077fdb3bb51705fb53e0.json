Borrowing inspiration from American muscle cars, Flathead not only sports a highly-unique shape, but backs it up with a high-octane blend. Instead of the traditional round or torpedo shaped head, this sleek handmade is completely squared off. CAO Flathead starts with a well-fermented Connecticut Broadleaf maduro wrapper. Thick and chewy, the leaf conceals a bevy of Nicaraguan and Dominican long-fillers embraced by a Connecticut Habano-seed binder. Then, each cigar is carefully box-pressed. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
