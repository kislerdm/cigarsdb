The cigar features a leathery, oily, dark Ecuadorian Sumatra-seed wrapper that covers a Connecticut Broadleaf binder and a Nicaraguan filler. This is a bold, peppery smoke that is balanced by an underlying sweetness. The blend was developed by legendary cigar crafter AJ Fernandez. The cigars are handmade in Nicaragua at the Tabacalera Fernandez factory. The TAA is a group of the top tobacconists in the nation.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
