Blended by Christian Eiroa of CLE Cigars at the Aladino factory in Honduras. CBT Maduro makes use of 100% maduro leaves – the wrapper, binder, and filler are all maduro leaves harvested from only the plant’s top primings. An extremely difficult-to-blend combination, but Eiroa nailed it…again. CBT Maduro is smooth and ultra-rich with hearty, charred notes of wood, pepper, espresso, dark chocolate, and a long, bold, and meaty finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2014","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
