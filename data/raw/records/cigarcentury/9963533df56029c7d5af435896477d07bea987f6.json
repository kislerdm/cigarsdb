Jose Pepin Garcia could not have imagined at that moment that his love and passion for cigars would help him to build one of the most recognized companies in \nThe Garcia Family continues to follow the tradition they lived and learned in Cuba and proudly own two factories, the headquarters in Doral, which is a boutique factory with a team of twelve expert cigar rollers trained by Don Pepin himself. The other is the Garcia Family Industrial Park in Estel√≠, Nicaragua with more than three hundred cigar rollers. Both factories are responsible for the twelve company owned brands that exist in the marketplace today.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":85},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
