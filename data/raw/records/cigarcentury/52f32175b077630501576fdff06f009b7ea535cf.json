Handmade using an abbreviated fermentation to lock in the tobacco’s native flavors and added a longer aging process to refine them. Some may confuse it with the original Flathead, but the V19 has a kick of their own.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Katman","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":95}]}
