The story begins with Max Berger who fled Poland during World War II for Cuba where he owned well known cigar making factories. He later fled communist Cuba for Miami, \nAmong the most well-known 5 Vegas blends are the 90+ rated 5 Vegas Classic, which features Nicaraguan Habano and Dominican long-fillers. This is the blend that started it all for the brand.  You can expect high quality smokes steeped in the Cuban tradition, all at reasonable prices. "}
