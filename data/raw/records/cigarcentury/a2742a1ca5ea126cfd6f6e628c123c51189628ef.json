He's worked side-by-side with Pepin for years and has had in hands in a number of projects. But now, he's got his own eponymous brand - blended entirely solo.Jaime Garcia Reserva Especial utilizes a dark, oily Broadleaf maduro wrapper paired with a rich blend of Nicaraguan long-fillers with tobaccos from some of the Garcia family's farms. It's on the fuller side, but smooth and layered with notes of espresso, pepper, earth, and cedar. A tasty, well-made stick that will make the old man proud. Burn one of these, and you'll experience the artisanal skill of this family history.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
