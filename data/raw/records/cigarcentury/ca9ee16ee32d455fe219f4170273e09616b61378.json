Boasting an Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper, an authentic Corojo binder, and a perfect blend of Honduran and Dominican Aleman ligero long-fillers, you can expect a spicy kick that’s not too overwhelming. Referred to as a “utility cigar,” this is the handmade you’ll want to keep on hand for everyday use."}
