It’s a brand of cigars that comes out of Tabacalera William Ventura in the Dominican Republic. This is a factory that has earned a reputation for making cigars for companies such as Caldwell Cigar Company, La Barba Cigars, and Room101 Cigars. The Royal Return is actually a two-cigar line consisting of Queen’s Pearl, a Connecticut Shade; and King’s Gold, a Connecticut Broadleaf. In both cases, these are cigars that feature wrappers that had not been seen in the ADVentura portfolio to date. In this assessment we will look closer at the King’s Gold offering in the Toro size. The lines in the ADVentura Cigars portfolio have had a theme of exploration. This has been seen in offerings such as ADVentura – The Explorer, ADVentura – The Navigator, and ADVentura – The Conquerer. With ADVentura – The Royal Return, the theme focuses around explorers bringing back gifts for the Queen and King from a sea voyage. As the name indicates, this includes pearls for the Queen and gold for the King. Both the Queen’s Pearl and King’s Gold are positioned as more ultra-premium offerings in the ADVentura portfolio.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
