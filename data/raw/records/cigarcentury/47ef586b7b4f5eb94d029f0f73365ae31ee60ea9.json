A medium to full-bodied profile of molasses and black pepper delivers hints of citrus and cedar with an earthy aroma. Classic, handcrafted shapes showcase a somewhat coarse, veiny wrapper leaf in a blend that offers a distinct richness and depth.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
