These cigars are a pleasure to smoke, well balanced from start to end and in the milder side of the strength. These cigars have a sweetness that will delight your palate. Casa de Garcia Red cigars are wrapped using a Golden Connecticut leave that compliments the fusion of a Connecticut Broadleaf binder and long fillers tobaccos from Dominican Republic and Honduras. The result is a superb creamy and smooth blend at a price point that the completion can't afford.Â "}
