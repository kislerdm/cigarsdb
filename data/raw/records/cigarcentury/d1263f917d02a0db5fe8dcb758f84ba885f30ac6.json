Signature Series made in the Honduran factory, Las Lomas, feature a top-secret blend of premium tobaccos. Remarkably vibrant and savory, while remaining velvety and balanced. Boasting a complex profile, it is a masterpiece with no soft spots and almost invisible seams.Â CLE Signature Series PLDM (Primera Liga de Miami, in Spanish, first blend of Miami) are handmade in CLE's Miami factory by only three select rollers. The production is so small that according to Christian Eiroa, this can be called a \"gourmet\" cigar. Packaged in cedar boxes and unbanded, in tissue packs of five with a Boveda Humidity pack in each five-pack. The tissue used to wrap the cigars help the aging process, as do the unlacquered cedar boxes.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Public","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":80},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":73}]}
