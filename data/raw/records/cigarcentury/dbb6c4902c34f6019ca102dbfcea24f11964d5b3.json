From the warehouse’s “Bin Number 1,” the rare Cuban-seed, Dominican blend was aged for sixteen entire years before usage. Officially unveiled at the 2014 IPCPR trade show in Las Vegas, the Aging Room Bin No. 1 cigar gained many accolades for its mature, well-balanced, medium-body. Integral to the smoke, the Ecuadorian Habano wrapper, dressed around the perfectly-aged Dominican binder and filler, creates a naturally sweet flavor to counter the rich complexity. A sophisticated sight to behold with flavor to match, this cigar’s aged tobacco is sure to delight aficionados through each and every draw.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":81},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
