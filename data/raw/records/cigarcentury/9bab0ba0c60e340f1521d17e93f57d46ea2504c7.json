A cigar maker was hell-bent on proving he could capture the essence - the core - of a cigar's flavor immediately upon lighting and throughout the duration of the cigar. You hit the sweet spot right away with Nub cigars. Nub offers you a variety of wrappers \nOliva deliberately designed these Nubs to provide cigar connoisseurs with the best experience possible. Boasting a variety of profiles, Nub is crafted in four wrappers: Cameroon, Connecticut, Habano or Brazilian. Short in length, but big on flavor, Nub nails its mark."}
