Hailing from Green Bay, Wisconsin, the brand pays homage to the classic \"Ain't They Lovely\" line from Wisconsin's bygone era, extending its legacy into the modern day. By infusing contemporary blends with a nod to the past, Lovely Cigars encapsulates the essence of yesteryear. Each cigar is enveloped in an Ecuadorian Habano leaf, bound with Mexican craftsmanship, and filled with Nicaraguan richness. The Elegante variety offers a complex smoking experience, exuding enchanting notes of coffee, cedar, cream, and sweet spice. Hand-crafted in Nicaragua and released quarterly, these cigars are a true testament to timeless artistry."}
