This mild to medium smoke is made from Nicaraguan filler and binder tobaccos with a Nicaraguan wrapper. Early reviews are largely positive and talk about the cigar's notes of honey, coffee, citrus, and a cream fade. The Back2Back Urny Nicaragua boxes are collectibles in their own right, with a riot of color and urban design. The bands on the cigars mirror the box motif.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
