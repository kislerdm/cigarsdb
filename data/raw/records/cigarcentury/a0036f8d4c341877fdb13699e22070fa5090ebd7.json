Inc., which is overseen by Tabacalera USA, is the manufacturer and distributor of such non-Cuban premium cigar brands as Montecristo, Romeo y Julieta, and H. Upmann. All the company's cigars are made at the immense Tabacalera de Garcia factory in the Dominican Republic. In 1999, France's SEITA S.A. and Spain's Tabacalera S.A. merged, creating Altadis, and later that year, Altadis bought half of Cuba's Habanos S.A., and was itself acquired by Imperial Tobacco PLC in 2007. In 2017, the company took over distribution of all brands made by Boutique Blends Cigars. In addition to its premium cigar business, Altadis also has a healthy machine-made cigar operation. The brands in the non-Cuban Montercristo portfolio run the gamut from mild to full body, and include such popular lines as Montecristo White, Montecristo Classic, and Montecristo Platinum. "}
