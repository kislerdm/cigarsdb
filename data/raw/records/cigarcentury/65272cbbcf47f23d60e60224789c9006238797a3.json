Caldwell Cigar Company was created with a very simple agenda: \"to create special cigars using well aged rare tobaccos and to enjoy the \nCaldwell products are built using very well aged and rare tobaccos. They use such aged tobacco to provide year-over-year consistency in flavor and experience.  To control consistency, they age the tobacco for a very long time. The company has always leaned towards tobaccos that were harder to procure, or more limited in nature, so that they can deliver a flavor that isn’t quite what you cigar aficionados are used to."}
