This centuries-old technique involves blending vintages of wine together to create a wine made of different ages. Nodal wondered if the same practice could be applied to cigars. To test his theory, Rafael mixed tobaccos from different vintages into bales and allowed them to age together. Thereby, marrying the aged tobaccos before rolling them. Thus, the Aging Room Solera cigar was born. The Solera Maduro features a dark Mexican San Andres wrapper with binder and filler made of Dominican Habano tobaccos. A medium-bodied smoke, the Aging Room Solera Maduro offers a well-balanced combination of sweetness and spice with a fruity note."}
