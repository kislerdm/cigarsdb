In 2011, to help him with his new venture, Heaps enlisted Claudio Sgroi, an Italian educator turned master blender under the mentorship of Hendrik “Henke” Kelner, Davidoff’s chief cigarmaker. Mombacho cigars are handmade in Nicaragua using traditional rolling methods. They are noted for their superb construction, rich aroma, and complexity of flavors."}
