Hailing from Nicaragua, the Mayans cigar sports a stunning Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper that protects the skillfully combined mixture of Dominican and Nicaraguan binder and filler, to produce a medium to full-bodied profile full of rich earth, wood, chocolate, and pepper. Solid construction and equal burn finish out creating an experience that revs across and excites your palate from start to finish."}
