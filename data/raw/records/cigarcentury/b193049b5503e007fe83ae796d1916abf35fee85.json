It looks real nice. Smooth dark wrapper, slightly oily, not densely packed but not loose either. Feels good with no aparent soft spots. The wrapper aroma is manure and barnyard, very rich. The first half of the cigar has vegetal, barnyard notes, burnt wood, maybe cedar. As the cigar slips into the second half some sweetness comes in."}
