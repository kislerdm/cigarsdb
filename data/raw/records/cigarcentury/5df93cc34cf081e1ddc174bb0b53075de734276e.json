Insidious is a mild to medium smoke and just like the other cigars in the Asylum portfolio, it is an affordable premium quality stick. Insidious utilizes the first Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper leaf of any Asylum release. Smooth and creamy, this wrapper conceals Honduran long-fillers and a Honduran binder, all combined to produce a relaxing, mellow experience. Each of the five vitolas in the line boasts a price point less than five buckaroos, making this sweet snack both easy on the palate and easy on the wallet."}
