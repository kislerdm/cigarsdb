It consists of an Ecuadoran Connecticut wrapper around a blend of less powerful Honduran and Nicaraguan tobacco. Those are made in Altadis’s Flor de Copan factory in Honduras. The new full-bodied Gispert Intenso goes in the opposite direction and is another recent example of Altadis’s willingness to partner with other cigar makers for novel interpretations of its heritage brand. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2004","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2003","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
