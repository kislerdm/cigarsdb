And The Original Diploma is one of their finest and most sought after blends created. It originally debuted in 2001 but soon vanished from the market. Then we saw it again in 2015 for a short run. Then in 2017, \nThe blend uses some of the finest tobaccos in the world and is crafted by Camacho’s 5 most skilled torcedores (rollers) in the factory with the leaves hand-selected by the factory supervisor to ensure the best experience possible. The tobacco used is all Honduran Corojo from higher priming’s to add a little extra power. The end result is a medium to full-bodied cigar with balanced notes of wood, cocao, dried fruit, and some pepper on the finish. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2008","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
