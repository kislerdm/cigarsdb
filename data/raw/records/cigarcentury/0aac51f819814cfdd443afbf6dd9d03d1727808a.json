The impetus of the cigar is his love for Cuban Seed Habano and obsession with Seco leaf heavy blends. Particularly, their leasing and complex aroma. Every element in the band and packaging design are nods to Gonzalo’s Cuban origins. To the elegance of traditional cigars and Ian fascination with them."}
