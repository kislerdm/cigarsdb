Originally released in 2004 as a response to market demand for a stronger Cohiba cigar, the XV (“extra vigoroso”) showcases a sun-grown Sumatra wrapper that is tercio-aged for three years before rolling. This aging process works to tame the robust character of the wrapper leaf just enough to give it a smooth and refined quality to complement the flavorful Nicaraguan Ligero and Dominican Piloto Cubano Ligero fillers and three-year-old Connecticut Broadleaf binders that the XV is comprised of.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2004","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
