They offer the perfect balance of flavors along with a nice creamy mixture of molasses, cedarwood, and walnut. The flavor doesn't stop there, these cigars also offer wonderful notes of orange zest and chocolate to help round out the whole experience. El Septimo Diamond Collection Excepcion Esmeralda cigars pair perfectly with a cappuccino."}
