Created by Dion Giolito, a cigar retailer with an exacting palate and a vivid imagination from Reno, Nevada, many Illusiones have names that allude to conspiracies, or codes that reveal only part of his message. Rolled primarily with Nicaraguan tobaccos in Nicaragua and Honduras, Illusiones are often flavorful, but rarely strong."}
