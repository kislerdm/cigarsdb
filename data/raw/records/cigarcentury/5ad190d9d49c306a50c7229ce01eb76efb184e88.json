It is a medium strength cigar that features a Cameroon-seed wrapper that was grown in the Jamastran Valley in Honduras.

Once lit, the Aladino Cameroon delivers warm notes of spice with an underlying sweetness and creaminess.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
