Founded by a trio of engineers, the company is committed to applying German engineering principles to cigar production, emphasizing craftsmanship and the cigar itself rather than traditional packaging and marketing. Their first release, the Rauchvergn√ºgen #42, reflects this approach by focusing on the cigar's volume rather than conventional branding elements. Although the blend details are not disclosed, the company describes the cigar as'medium-bodied', providing smokers with a unique and customized experience that differs from typical cigar releases."}
