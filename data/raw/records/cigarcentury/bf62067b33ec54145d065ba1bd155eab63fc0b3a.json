Unlimited is rich, complex, full-bodied and ultra-flavorful....carefully crafted into 4 stately, big ring vitolas and booming with gobs of flavor, boldness, denseness and complexity. In spades. Then double it. Then multiply by six. That's about right. Diesel Unlimited is fitted with a dark, Habano Ecuador ligero wrapper leaf - oozing with oils, it looks like a tasty chocolate candy bar. Rich long-leaf filler tobaccos from Condega and Esteli Nicaragua meld with spicy San Andres leaves to create a strikingly robust and randy blend with intensely lush flavors. Expect notes of leather, spice, earth and oak, rounding out its toasty tobacco core. Smooth, slow-burning, zesty, full-flavored. Unlimited.Â "}
