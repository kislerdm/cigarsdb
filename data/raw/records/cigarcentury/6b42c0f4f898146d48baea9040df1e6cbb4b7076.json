He put together a team of  Cuban agronomists and took them to Nicaragua. They recreated the style and aroma of Cuban leaf using traditional Cuban methods in conjunction with the resources available to them in Nicaragua. The tobacco they cultivated is named Aganorsa Leaf. Aganorsa Leaf is renowned throughout the world for its signature flavor that possesses all the great attributes of Nicaraguan terroir along with classic Cuban aroma and flavor. As a vertically integrated company, Aganorsa Leaf oversees the entire production process—from seed to ash—ensuring every cigar consistently produces maximum pleasure. Every cigar rolled in their factories in Nicaragua and Miami is composed of the highest grade Aganorsa Leaf. When you smoke one of the world class blends, you will experience the difference between ordinary tobacco and Aganorsa Leaf. "}
