To honor his family and heritage, J.C. modeled the Brick House label after his childhood home, the only brick house in their small, Hungarian village. Locals and visitors would gather at the house nightly to eat, drink, smoke and enjoy each other’s company. But with the Great Depression came the end of the Brick House. Over 80 years later, grandsons Eric and Bobby Newman relaunched Brick House using the most exquisite Nicaraguan tobaccos.  Wrapped in a hearty Havana Subido™ leaf, every cigar features a rich blend of Nicaraguan tobaccos carefully hand-rolled by master artisans. Aged in the mountains of Nicaragua, every Brick House cigar is a melding of flawless construction, superb quality and master blend at an economical price point. The result is a medium to full-bodied cigar that's rich, flavorful, and smooth. The Brick House brand has become a best seller nationwide. Awards include the Best Bargain Cigar and a place in the Top 25 Cigars by Cigar Aficionado in 2010 and 2016. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
