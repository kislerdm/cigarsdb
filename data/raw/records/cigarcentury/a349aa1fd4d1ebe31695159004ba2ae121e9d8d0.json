Consisting of three brands - FLOR DE SELVA, CUMPAY, and VILLA ZAMORANO. CUMPAY was launched in 1999 from the volcanic highlands of Nicaragua’s Jalapa valley. “Cumpay\" is the Tawakha Indian name for a rolled tobacco leaf. With a complex range of aromas, a hint of roasted coffee, hazelnut, and leather. The Maya Selva Cumpay is basically a Nicaraguan puro but the fillers and binders used in the different vitolas are unique for all of them. It boasts of a medium full bodied strength with an impeccable construction reflected in its perfect draw and even burn."}
