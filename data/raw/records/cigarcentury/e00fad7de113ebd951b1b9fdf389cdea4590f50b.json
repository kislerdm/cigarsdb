Flores brand, and will be produced in limited runs to be released only twice per year. The A. Flores Connecticut Valley Reserve comes in two versions: Azul and Roja. Azul (“blue” in Spanish) has a lighter Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper that Flores categorizes as “claro,” while the Roja line (“red” in Spanish) has a darker Connecticut broadleaf wrapper classified as “maduro.” Both lines are made with Nicaraguan binders and a filler blend of Nicaraguan and Dominican tobacco. "}
