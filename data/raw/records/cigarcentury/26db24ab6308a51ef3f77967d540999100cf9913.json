A cigar maker was hell-bent on proving he could capture the essence - the core - of a cigar's flavor immediately upon lighting and throughout the duration of the cigar. You hit the sweet spot right away with Nub cigars. Nub offers you a variety of wrappers \nOliva deliberately designed these Nubs to provide cigar connoisseurs with the best experience possible. Boasting a variety of profiles, Nub is crafted in four wrappers: Cameroon, Connecticut, Habano or Brazilian. Short in length, but big on flavor, Nub nails its mark.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Public","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":82},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
