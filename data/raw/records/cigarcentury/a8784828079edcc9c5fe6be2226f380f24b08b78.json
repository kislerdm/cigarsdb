Much like crafting a memorable cigar. \nThe Sunday Gravy is the first Diesel cigar to be offered by the Forge Cigar Company (which is part of Scandinavian Tobacco Group who also owns General Cigar Co.) The blends were developed by master cigar blender AJ Fernandez and Justin Andrews, Diesel’s Senior Brand Manager. The cigars are crafted at AJ’s Tabacalera Fernandez factory in Nicaragua."}
