The latest offerings are Pupil and Master. Both cigars are made at Joya de Nicaragua. The Master is a Nicaraguan puro, while Pupil uses an Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper over Nicaraguan fillers. Outside of that, the wrapper looks good with no discoloration or water spots. I don’t get a ton of aroma from the Pupil’s wrapper, and what it does offer smells a bit like a pretzel with some barnyard flavors.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":85}]}
