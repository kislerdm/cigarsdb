There are so many amazing things to say about this cigar, we almost don't know where to start. Before you even light this cigar, you will admire the presentation of the soft, orange Brazilian wrapper, with a crisp aroma of hay and cedar. Once lit, the complexity of flavors hits the palette; including citrus, butterscotch, cinnamon, and honey. This bold profile actually gets stronger as the cigar progresses, leaving you wanting more as you bask in the smoky aromas. The Laranja Reserva is a cigar that you want to enjoy on a fresh palette at the end of a long day; so keep a 20-count box at home in your humidor to enjoy the moment you walk in the door.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
