Theyâ€™re both industry leaders, paving the way for a new generation of aficionados with innovative \u0026 provocative packaging and truly unique blending. La Coalicion is a fully collaborative effort between these two titans, and the results are nothing short of extraordinary. A beautifully oily Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper conceals a Sumatran binder and fillers from Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, and produces a full-bodied bevy of earth, coffee, and raisin notes. This specimen was crafted by two men with a shared vision, and the expertise and resources to bring it to life.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
