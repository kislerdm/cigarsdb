For the unique factor, Brown created the cigar to have a signature linear cap, made of strips of natural tobacco wound around the Maduro wrapper resembling bee-stripes.Â The dark Ecuadorian Maduro wrapper encases fiery Nicaraguan binder and filler that produces a full-bodied profile, filled with notes of pepper, earth, and wood that make a bee-line for the palate and swarm the senses.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
