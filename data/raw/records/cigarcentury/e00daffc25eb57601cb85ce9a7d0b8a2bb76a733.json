It still offers the same flavor profile and strength that has made Aganorsa Leaf a globally recognized brand. The cigars are handmade in the small factory located in the companyâ€™s headquarters in Miami, Florida.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Snob","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigars Daily","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
