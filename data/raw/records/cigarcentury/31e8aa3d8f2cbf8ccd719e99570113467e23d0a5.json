It is said that Don Francisco was an elegant person whose concern for appearance was transferred to the Habanos brand he created: presenting his Habanos in an original tissue paper that wraps them all together. Even \nFonseca cigars are a mild to medium-bodied cigar, a marriage of the choicest Dominican leaves grown in the fertile Cibao Valley of the Dominican Republic with a mexican tobacco binder. Fonseca cigars are available in a silky, Ecuadorian Connecticut shade natural wrapper or in a more flavorful and dark broadleaf maduro.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":82},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":82},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":71},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2008","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2006","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2004","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2003","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
