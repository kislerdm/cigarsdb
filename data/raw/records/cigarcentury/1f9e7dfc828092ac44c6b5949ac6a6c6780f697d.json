Long filler tobaccos from Nicaragua and Columbia, held together with a Nicaraguan Habano binder and wrapped up with a stunning deep brown Nicaraguan Jalapa wrapper. This powerhouse stick is going to fill your palate with notes of black pepper, leather, wood, cocoa, and caramel, that all remain perfectly balanced from start to finish. The story behind the Odyssey goes as follows: six different Cuban-seed fillers, Habano-seed binder and an Ecuadorian wrapper. Perhaps more noted, the cigar was allegedly aged for five years prior to its September 1, 2000 release. Given the release and alleged roll date, CAO diehards will know these came from Tabacalera Perdomo, the factory that produced some of the legendary earlier CAOs. "}
