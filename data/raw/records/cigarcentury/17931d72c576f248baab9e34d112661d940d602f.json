A line of unique blends and vitolas made in extremely limited quantities that reflect the blending machinations of myself. They include many different expressions and are often crafted of leaf I am less familiar with or not even a particular fan of to create something of worth beyond my own previous experiences. To smoke a Muestra de Saka is to embark upon a journey with me in which I greatly welcome your companionship.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":92},{"who":"Katman","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
