This remarkably rich soil is prized for its unique flavors that can only be found in this lush fertile Island set beneath two majestic volcanic mountains. Aging Room Bin No. 2 cigars capture the splendor of Ometepe with rich full-flavored notes of leather, wood, and spice, enriched with a sweet creamy finish."}
