Draped in a flawless Ecuador Connecticut wrapper, and chock full of aged long-fillers from Honduras, each CLE Connecticut dishes out a barrage of soothing flavor. Hints of roasted nuts, cream, leather, and a dash of spices enter the fray before a long crisp finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
