To create this hefty 6 x 60 stick, a vintage Dominican Criollo 98 binder and a filler blend of Cuban-seed Dominican tobaccos are rolled inside a seamless golden-brown Ecuador Connecticut wrapper. The result is a medium-bodied smoke with rich notes of coffee, cream, and nuts, punctuated with hints of spice and warm honey."}
