Two months later, we learned the name of that new company was Wildfire Cigar Co. and that the first two blends were being produced at Fábrica de Tabacos Joya de Nicaragua, S.A. factory in Nicaragua. The Single also features plenty of both tooth and veins along with some noticeable oil. The cigar is quite hard when squeezed, but there are no soft spots on any of the samples that I could find after an inspection. After a straight cut, the cold draw brings flavors of some of the same cinnamon and orange peel along with peanut shells, vegetal and some honey sweetness."}
