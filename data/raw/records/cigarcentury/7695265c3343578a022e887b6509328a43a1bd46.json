And celebrate it does, thanks to a gorgeous Habano-seed wrapper overtop a flavorful blend of aged long-fillers grown throughout Honduras. The cigar is mellow yet bursting with character. Medium in body, each expertly crafted vitola issues a deep, toasty bouquet offering sweet cedar, earth, a touch of coffee bean, and a hint of spice on the long finish. Supremely complex, in true Eiroa fashion, yet silky smooth and tame from start to finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
