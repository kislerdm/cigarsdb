They employed Davidoff's master blender, Henke Kelner, to create the Occidental Reserve, the response proved that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and that pushed them to continue to develop cigars that \nHowever, Alan and Ralph hit their stride as late as 2007 with their first full-bodied cigar called the Tempus. No other Alec Bradley cigar offered a strength profile as powerful and perfectly balanced as the Alec Bradley Tempus. It was an instant success, which sent the company into overdrive.
