The Turrent family was the pioneer of Mexican tobacco and the founders of the Te Amo brand. Aficionados owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the Turrent family and the enlightenment they provided to the cigar industry. In the 1880’s, Alberto Turrent immigrated to Mexico. Alberto was born in Spain but had spent a great deal of time in Cuba. When he settled in Mexico, he brought along Cuban tobacco seeds and found that the fertile volcanic soil of the San Andres region was optimal for cultivating exquisite flavorful tobacco.For four generations, the Turrent family grew tobacco for other people to use. Then in 1963, the Te Amo brand was established by the fourth generation of the Turrent family, who is also happens to be named Alberto. Eventually, Consolidated Cigar Co. took up the Te Amo distribution. In 2000, Consolidated Cigar Co. merged with Altadis and Te Amo became an Altadis-owned brand but is still produced by the Turrent family. The fifth Turrent generation, Alejandro, also joined the family business. Alejandro started out working in the family factory and became one of the most respected cigar makers in the industry. After the merger, Alejandro landed a position as an Altadis cigar master. Te Amo took advantage of the opportunity. They added lines such as the Te Amo World Selection Serie","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2008","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
