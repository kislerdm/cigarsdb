Flores AFRs. Only rolled by Abe’s four most-skilled torcedors, and utilizing the finest, hand-selected tobacco leaves, AFR-75 truly represents one of the most respectable blends on the market. Today, we’re looking at the Claro version of this masterpiece. Utilizing a lighter-colored Mexican wrapper leaf, AFR-75 Claro features a Nicaraguan Criollo ’98 binder and long-filler leaves from the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and the United States. Delivering a mixture of cream, cedar, and a slightly fruity note, AFR-75 Claro is delicious down to the nub.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
