They’re smooth, sleek, and delicious - and with just enough Nicaraguan oomph. This limited-release cigar utilizes a rare Esteli-grown Engañoso leaf over a hearty Connecticut Broadleaf binder and five select tobaccos from Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. The taste is rich, leading the way with notes of cocoa, raisins, and white pepper for a lavish smoking experience."}
