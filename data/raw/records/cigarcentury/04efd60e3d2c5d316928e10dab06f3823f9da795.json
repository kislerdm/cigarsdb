The first thing you’ll notice is the highly unique, Habano and Candela barber-pole wrapper. No chance of flying under the radar while enjoying this one. The second thing to catch your eye will probably be the massive sizes – other than the traditional 5\"x50 robusto. The blend itself is a Nicaraguan puro, and is very similar to the original Asylum 13, with a complex, full-bodied array of flavors that are sure to satisfy.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
