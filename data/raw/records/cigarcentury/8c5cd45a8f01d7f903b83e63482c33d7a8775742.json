Turrent Puro Corojo cigars are the product of a 5-generation tobacco family and the legacy of an 89-rating just a few years back. A short-lived tour into the forgotten aisles of cigar obscurity nearly turned the lights out on the A. Turrent brand for good – that is, until your pals at Holt’s worked their magic with the prices on a recently discovered shipment. Courtesy of our sharp math skills and a boisterous inventory level, we’re happy to offer luscious Cuban-seed Corojo wrappers with succulent spices and a fruity profile including notes of coffee, earth and pepper for mere pennies per puff. A. Turrent Puro Corojo is complex and medium to full in body with a stunning zest.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
