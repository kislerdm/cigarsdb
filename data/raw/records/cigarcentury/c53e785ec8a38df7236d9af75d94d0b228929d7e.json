The name pays tribute to the indigenous people of the Caribbean, known as the Taíno, who are believed to be the original creators of the modern day cigar. This blend was created with the classics in mind, easy-going with a ton of character. A cigar approachable for enthusiasts of all levels, yet nuanced enough for the connoisseur. This medium-bodied smoke highlights all the best qualities of the Caribbean.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
