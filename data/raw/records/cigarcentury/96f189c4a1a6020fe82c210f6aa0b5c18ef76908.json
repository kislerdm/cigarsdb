This wrapper is the product of years of hybridization and selection and delivers a smooth, creamy and slightly spicy aroma and smooth finish to these beautifully constructed cigars.Â The word criollo means \"native seed\" in Spanish and it is this native, Cuban seed that eventually lead to the Criollo 98 wrapper leaf. Combining this outstanding wrapper from Nicaragua and an all Nicaraguan long-filler blend, the CAO Criollo cigars provide the well-heeled cigar smoker a truly unique medium bodied smoking experience.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2005","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2003","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2002","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
