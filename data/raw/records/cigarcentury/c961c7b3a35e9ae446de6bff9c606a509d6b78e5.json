Most cigar guys like an earth-shaking, powerful blend now and then; they also like ice cream too, but no one likes it shoveled by the gallon into their face. That's why this classic maduro answers the bell like few others: an uncanny level of smooth, rich, sweet flavors in concert with a remarkably mellow bouquet."}
