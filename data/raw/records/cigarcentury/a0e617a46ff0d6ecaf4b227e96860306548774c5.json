They teamed up with Rocky Patel to bring their vision to life, and the vitola names represent someone special along the way in their journey. Those cigar runs turned into a job as a retailer, then a sales rep for Davidoff, then VP of sales for CAO, and culminated in him starting his own brand: All Saints. He has been involved in premium cigars for over 20 years and is now bringing us the fruits of his labor, the All Saints Dedication.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":87}]}
