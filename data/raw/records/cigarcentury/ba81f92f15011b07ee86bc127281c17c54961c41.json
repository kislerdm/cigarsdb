Cigar Culture is a movement that is dedicated to providing information and educating cigar lovers and the public about the tobacco and cigar industry. The Blackbird Hawk celebrates the non-traditional approach smaller boutique cigar crafters have used to capture the attention of cigar aficionados. The Hawk features a savory, dark tanned Brazilian Cubra wrapper thatâ€™s draped over a Mexican San Andres binder and long-filler leaves from the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. The cigars are handmade at the Blackbird Dominicana Cigar Factory in the Dominican Republic."}
