Viaticum this is a true testament to what Black Label Trading Co. Cigars represents: mouth-watering flavors with a perfect balance between strength and complexity. Hand Rolled at La Fabrica Oveja Negra in a box-pressed format, the unique blend is composed of finely aged Nicaraguan and Honduran long-filler tobaccos enclosed in a bold yet ever-so-smooth Ecuadorian Maduro wrapper. Hints of creamy espresso, zesty white pepper, smokey cedar, and fresh dark cocoa are in this medium to full-bodied profile.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
