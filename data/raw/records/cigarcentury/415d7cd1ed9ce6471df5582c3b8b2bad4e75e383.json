And, although a mixed-filler blend, the burn is surprisingly slow and even. Rosa Cuba has a solid Nicaraguan flavor profile with an inherent sweetness that tobaccos from this country seem to provide. Rosa Cuba is a gingerbread-hued Ecuador Sumatra wrapper embraces a premium Cuban-sandwich blend of zesty Nicaraguan tobaccos handmade in a wide variety of traditional shapes. This cigarÂ deliver resplendent notes of coffee beans, toasted nuts, cedar, and peppery spices."}
