Inside each box you’ll find 14 Ecuador Habano Oscuro wrapped gems. The dark, oily wrapper leaf sits atop a potent firecracker blend of all long-fillers from three different regions in Nicaragua, plus some additional Esteli ligero to put this one over the top. Each puff delivers a chewy feast of bitter espresso, earth, black pepper, and salty leather. Prepare for your palate to kick into overdrive as you burn your fingers taking this one down to the nub.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":70}]}
