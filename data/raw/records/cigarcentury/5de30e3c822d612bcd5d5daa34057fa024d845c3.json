Newman Cigar Company, Diamond Crown producer, has finally unveiled their newest creation - the Black Diamond Cigar. It was rumored that the Diamond Crown Maduro was going to rebrand into Black Diamond but this little project took a turn for the best. The tobacco used for the filler and binder is from the Fuente Farm located in the Dominican Republic. The wrapper used to hold all of the tobacco together is an 8yr double-fermented Sun Grown Connecticut Shade wrapper. This thing is a beauty. Available in three sizes; Emerald, Radiant and Marquis, the Black Diamond cigar is sure to be a perfect fit in the Diamond Crown family.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":93},{"who":"Cigars Lover","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Katman","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
