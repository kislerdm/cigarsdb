La Herencia Cubana arrives on the scene. This is a legit, thoroughly delectable cigar. The wrapper is a dark, toothy, leathery-looking Ecuadorian Sumatra leaf that's responsible for delivering much of the intense, rich flavory goodness. The fillers are a well-balanced collection of long-leaf tobaccos from three of the major growing regions in Nicaragua: Jalapa, Condega, and Esteli.The flavor is medium to full in body and begins with a burst of black pepper, a feisty opening that's tamed by a rich yet smooth core of tobacco flavors and underlying creaminess that's present right on through to the cigar's conclusion. Its hearty bouquet is coupled with toasty, woodsy notes and a long-lasting, peppery aftertaste."}
