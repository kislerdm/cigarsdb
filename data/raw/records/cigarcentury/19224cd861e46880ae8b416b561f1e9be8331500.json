The blend features an Ecuadorian wrapper, a thick Connecticut Broadleaf binder, and perfectly aged filler tobaccos from Nicaragua.   Although strong, Body Cast is refined, well balanced, and loaded with hearty notes of black pepper, chocolate, and plenty of spice.  This seriously powerful follow up to the original full flavored Boneshaker blend will take your palate to a completely new level of intensity without hardly putting a dent in your wallet.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Katman","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
