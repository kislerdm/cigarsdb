On the outside, a dark Nicaraguan maduro glistens with oils and boasts a mouthwatering, toothy texture. Inside, a robust blend of aged Cuban-seed long-leaf tobaccos marries to promote a rich, medium to full-bodied profile layered with satisfying flavors. Expect a classic combination of earth and coffee complemented by a touch of spice on the finish. Naturally, quality is top-notch with each slow-burning cigar, so sit back and savor this impressive super-premium.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":89}]}
