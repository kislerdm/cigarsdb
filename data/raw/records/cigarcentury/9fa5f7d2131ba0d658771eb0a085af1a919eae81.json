As you'd expect from AJ, this blend is full-flavored and full-bodied, yet its approachable balance sets it aside from the rest. A superb recipe including a Cuban-seed \nThe term â€˜Cuban-esque' gets thrown around quite often these days, but honestly, that wouldn't begin to do this one justice. Simply, yet aptly dubbed Relic, this affordable luxury of historic proportions is truly a trace of the past. Liken to a mysterious ancient artifact, a heavy, rustic wood box is enclosed by a worn and weathered box strip. The cigars are laid to rest and rotated in unison with unique, dual sided bands featuring an ancient gargoyle relic perched inside a stone window. But beyond its antique and somewhat menacing appearance lies a more important discovery."}
