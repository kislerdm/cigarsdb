Lame jokes aside, this box-pressed Nicaraguan cigar is the newest offering from CLE, and is sure to deliver a bold, rich blend to any cigar enthusiast. While its sister blend CLE Chele is slang for white, this one is slang for dark. And Christian delivers on that “dark” theme by using the first Broadleaf maduro in any CLE release. All that being said, I’m sure you’d all just like to know how the blend turned out. And I’m happy to report, this was a successful experiment. CLE Prieto is a delicious medium to full-bodied blend that booms out thick clouds of smoke with every puff. Complex coffee and chocolate notes make this one a must-try for fans of robust blends. "}
