Kurt Kendall released these cigars to honor his late son, William, who passed away in 2011. As tributes go, a finer cigar could not have been chosen: Nicaragua and Honduras fillers are paired with a Honduras binder and draped in a silky Ecuador Connecticut wrapper. And presented in 5 common sizes, the 7-20-4 WK stands ready to suit almost anyone’s preference - leaning in with smooth and well-balanced flavors. Celebrate love, and join Kurt in his tribute."}
