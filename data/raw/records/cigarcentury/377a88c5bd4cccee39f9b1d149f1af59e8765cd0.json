Their first venture into premium handmades was a limited release called Blind Faith, and the first batch quickly sold out. Their second is called Gatekeeper, and trust me when I say, the brothers are already at the top of their game. Gatekeeper comes dressed in an Ecuador Habano wrapper over a Nicaraguan binder, with fillers from the Dominican and Nicaragua. Its smooth, rich profile is accentuated by notes of cedar, nuts, and leather, and the construction is what you would expect from the factory that produces such great sticks as the Prensado.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Public","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":87},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2021","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Dojo","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
