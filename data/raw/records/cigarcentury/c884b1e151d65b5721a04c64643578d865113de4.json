CAO Gold Maduro is a re-invention of one of the first 90-rated CAO blends. CAO Gold Maduro combined the mellow long-filler combination of Nicaraguan tobaccos used in the traditional Gold series, but wraps it in a dark and toothy Brazilian Maduro leaf. The result is a chewy, medium-bodied flavor with hints of coffee delivered in a most pleasing creamy, buttery fashion.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2007","ratingOutOf100":82}]}
