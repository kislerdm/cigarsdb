The return was in the form of an Edición Regional for Italy, a country that is notoriously difficult to obtain ERs from because of their strict policy on not allowing retailers to sell to people outside of the country. Four years later, the second release for the marca again falls to Italy for another ER, this time in a Hermosos No.4 vitola called the Don José.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2013","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
