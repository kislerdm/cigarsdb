A follow-up to the 90-rated CLE Corojo, CLE Plus has been described as “the full-bodied Corojo cigar the market has been looking for.” With good looks to spare, CLE Plus has an impressive construction that’s sure to please. Eiroa truly loves creating full-bodied cigars, as evident here with this superbly blended Honduran puro. This enticing handmade includes prominent notes of flavor including oak, spice, molasses, and earth. CLE Plus gets it right, and it’s sure to satisfy fans of bold, full-bodied cigars everywhere."}
