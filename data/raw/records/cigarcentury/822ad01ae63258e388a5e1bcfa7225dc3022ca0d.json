The cigars were produced in 2008. Since them, Quesada and Plasencia have created three delicious line extensions sure to appeal to the cigar aficionado looking for full flavored enjoyment at an affordable price. The original Colorado blend remains very popular and highly rated thanks to a bold recipe of all Nicaraguan tobaccos that produce rich flavors of coffee, leather, cedar, and raisins. The luxury Casa Magna Jalapa Claro Toro is a full-bodied gem dressed in a rare and delicious, golden brown Jalapa wrapper with well refined  flavors of pepper, cocoa, nuts, sweet cream, and cedar. The latest addition to this top-quality lineup is Casa Magna D. Magnus II, another Nicaraguan puro made with the best-aged tobaccos from the country’s most fertile growing regions. This full body cigar has a deep peppery core accented with subtle notes of cocoa, cedar, and nuts. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
