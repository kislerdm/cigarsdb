These limited-edition gems feature a sophisticated blend mixed with a top-shelf Ecuador Habano wrapper and binder over a whopping six-leaf combo of aged long fillers from Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico. My palate has an intensely complex full-bodied smoke effortlessly delivered by top-notch construction, and once lit, I experienced layer upon layer of espresso, malt, spice, white pepper, and cocoa. With these luxurious smokes being added to their top-rated portfolio.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Katman","year":"2024","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Katman","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":95},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":92}]}
