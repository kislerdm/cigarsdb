Often called \"red dot\" Cohibas due to the markings on the band, this exquisite cigar offers a medium-bodied flavor and a strong, smooth and incredibly rich character. Handmade with a toothy Cameroon wrapper and aged mixture of Dominican-grown Piloto Cubano tobaccos, Cohiba's blend sets the standard among today's premium cigars.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2011","ratingOutOf100":88},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2004","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
