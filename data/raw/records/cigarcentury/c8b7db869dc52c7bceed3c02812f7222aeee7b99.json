For those who don’t already know, Leaf by Oscar began as a small boutique project based out of Leaf and Bean, a tiny shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The owner of that shop is the man after whom this cigar is named: \nThe most recent cigar released is the Island Jim San Andres, which contains the same Honduran filler and binder, but is wrapped in a Mexican San Andres maduro leaf.  In typical Leaf by Oscar fashion. The packaging and presentation is just as cool as all other offerings from Leaf by Oscar, this time with a fun tropical island theme, naturally."}
