The other cigars in the Caldwell Collection are mellow, but this one takes a medium to full-bodied approach. Your palate will be instantly greeted with notes of earth, oak, dark chocolate, and hints of black pepper. It’s a demanding and satisfying cigar that you’ll want to give your full attention too. ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":90}]}
