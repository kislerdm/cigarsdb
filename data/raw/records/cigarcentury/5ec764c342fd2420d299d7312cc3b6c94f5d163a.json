This was the result of an absolute pile of \nBuffalo Trace cigars are made by General Cigar in Santiago, Dominican Republic. This operation also makes a number of lines for other premium cigar marks like Macanudo, Cohiba, Partagas, and La Gloria Cubana. It’s a great choice for a premium name like Buffalo Trace. And if you thought the cigar blenders would mail it in – think again. This one isn’t just a simple Dominican stick with a Buffalo Trace band on it; it’s an artful blend that could easily stand on its own out in our crowded industry. The long-fillers include Nicaraguan tobacco as well as barrel-aged Piloto Cubano. As you might expect, this is where Buffalo Trace cigars get some of their distinctive flavors. This blend is then bound with Brazilian arapiraca leaf and is finished off with an Ecuador Sumatra wrapper for an exotic flavor.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2023","ratingOutOf100":82}]}
