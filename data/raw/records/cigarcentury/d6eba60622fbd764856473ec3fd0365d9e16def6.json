The Nestor Miranda Collection would grow to four blends. While Nestor Miranda Collection would do quite well for Miami Cigar and Company, there were requests to bring back the Special Selection line. With 2019 being the 30th anniversary of Miami Cigar and Company, the company decided to bring back the Rosado blend of the Special Selection."}
