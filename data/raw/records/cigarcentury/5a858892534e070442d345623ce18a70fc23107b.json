James Hetfield and Rob Dietrich, inspired by their love of cigars and discussions about what makes great smoke, joined forces with Jonathan Drew to develop Blackened M81. This special cigar features a full composition of Maduro, from filling to wrapping, using bold Nicaraguan and Pennsylvania Broadleaf Maduro tobacco, a Connecticut River Valley Broadleaf Maduro folder, and a Mexican San Andres Maduro wrapper. With flavors of leather, dark chocolate and espresso, Blackened M81 is perfect for those with bold palates and reflects the creators' dedication to premium cigars."}
