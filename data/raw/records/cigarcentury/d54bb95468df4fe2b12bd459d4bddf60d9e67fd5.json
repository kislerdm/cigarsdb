All of the tobaccos are aged for a minimum of four years and chosen from the upper part of the plant for their richer flavor. Geared for more experienced cigar smokers, but restrained enough for some newer cigar smokers, the cigars are box-pressed, medium to full in body, and offer a spicy, full-flavored smoke with a long, velvety finish."}
