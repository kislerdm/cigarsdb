Aging Room Quattro Connecticut is the new name for the F55 cigar line. The cigar was design by Rafael Nodal in Domincan Republic and it has the reputation of being the smoothest blend yet. Features an Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper, Dominican binder and filler. The result is a mild to medium-bodied profileÂ that delivers notes of roasted nuts, cream, and a natural sweetness."}
