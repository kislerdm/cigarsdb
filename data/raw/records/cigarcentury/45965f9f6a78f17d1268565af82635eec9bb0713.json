Made with wrappers from Chateau de la Fuente, this line of cigars uses a Habano seed rather than the Corojo seed variety used to make the renown Fuente Fuente OpusX. The AniverXario Destino al Siglo will delight those who prefer a full-flavor, robust smoke. This cigar so exquisite, could only be contained in the finest packaging, from the beautifully detailed cigar band to the Spanish cedar lift-out trays, the packaging is ornate and designed so that is looks like a book. A century of destiny that marks a major milestone in the Fuente Family Story.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
