Alan Rubin brings to the world: Black Market Vandal. These cigars pack a four-country blend of long-filler tobacco with a secret special tobacco leaf that some believe is the secret to the entire stick. Outside the 6.2\" x 54 toro, you'll notice the Nicaraguan wrapper outside a Sumatra binder that helps deliver a lot of spice and pepper."}
