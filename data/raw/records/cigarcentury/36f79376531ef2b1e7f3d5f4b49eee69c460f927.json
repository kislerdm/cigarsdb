Ian Reith, Dapper Cigar Co. founder, approached Raul Disla of the Nicaragua American Cigars S.A. (NACSA) factory, and asked him if could recreate a version of the original. This resulted in a bolder and much more flavorful iteration of the original. Dislaâ€™s version uses the same blend but with more Nicaraguan tobacco.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Blind Mans Puff","year":"2022","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
