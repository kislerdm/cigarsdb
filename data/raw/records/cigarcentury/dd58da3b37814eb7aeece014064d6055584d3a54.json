Not a small feat, but the folks at Crowned Heads were up to the challenge. Described as being “big, bold, and gusty”, the Crowned Heads Headley Grange Black Lab LE 2018 features a dark, veiny USA Connecticut Habano wrapper, which covers a binder and filler made of fine Nicaraguan tobaccos. With its well-balanced flavor profile that is citrusy, peppery, and nutty, the Crowned Heads Headley Grange Black Lab LE 2018 is definitely the cigar of choice for when you want to jam out.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Halfwheel","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":89},{"who":"Cigar Coop","year":"2019","ratingOutOf100":91},{"who":"The Cigar Authority","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":93}]}
