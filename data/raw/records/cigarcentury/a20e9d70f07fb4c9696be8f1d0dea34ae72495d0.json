Felix Mesa, the owner, blender and tobacco grower has been experimenting with Cuban seed tobaccos grown in the Nicaraguan regions for a while. A very simple man with a huge passion for cigars he has given us great blends \nFelix Mesa, or El Guajiro as his friends like to call him, has come to the cigar world only to shine, and this latest edition, Vegas del Purial, is a blend that justifiably compares with the greatest cigars. The name is allegorical to a region in Cuba located in the Las Villas province, where his paternal grandparents, Felix and Caridad grew tobacco. Fond memories of those times are treasured by Felix Mesa, who decided to carry over the family tradition. Rolled with a well aged Ecuadorian Sumatra wrapper over a Nicaraguan binder and fillers, Vegas del Purial is a rich and flavorful smoke that will delight your taste buds."}
