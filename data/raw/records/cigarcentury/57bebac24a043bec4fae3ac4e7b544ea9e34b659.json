The Habano-seed wrapper hails from a small tobacco field located on the border of Nicaragua and Honduras, capturing the rich, hearty flavors of Honduras. This leaf is dark and leathery, and conceals a complex mixture of Cuban-seed long-fillers grown in both Nicaragua and Honduras. The cigar explodes with rich, but smooth flavors noting toasted wood and nuts. The finish is long and peppery with an enjoyable sweetness. The Magistri is a special size produced in limited quantities. Only 1,000 boxes were produced total, and each of these perfectos utilize a higher priming wrapper that is darker in color.Â ","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2020","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2018","ratingOutOf100":94},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":91}]}
