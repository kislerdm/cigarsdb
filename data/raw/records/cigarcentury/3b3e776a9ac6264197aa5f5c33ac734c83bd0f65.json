Their numerical moniker comes from the year 1600, when tobacco was first grown in Brazil, and the source of their dark, lustrous Habano wrappers. When added to the Honduran, Nicaraguan \u0026 Costa Rican filler core, they reveal a full-bodied smoke rippling with flavors of earth, wood, some sweetness, and a spicy aroma.Â "}
