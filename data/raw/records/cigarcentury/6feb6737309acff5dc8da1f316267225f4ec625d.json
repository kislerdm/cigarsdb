This cigar is a stunning showstopper. Draped in an exquisite Ecuadoran Havana wrapper and filled with perfectly balanced Nicaraguan and Dominican tobaccos, La Traviata is a favorite among many cigar enthusiasts. This medium-bodied handmade made the Top 25 Premium Cigars of the Year list by Cigar Aficionado not once, but twice! A well-performing beauty of a cigar also earned a well-deserved 93-rating for its full and complex Cuban-esque flavor."}
