Edgy packaging and limited production stirred the interests of small-batch fanatics familiar with other blends from Drew Estate and Caldwell. In All Out Kings, a medium to full-bodied profile is handcrafted from a complex recipe of Dominican, Indonesian, Connecticut Broadleaf, and Nicaraguan tobaccos beneath a Cuban-seed wrapper leaf grown in Connecticut. Notes of almonds, cashews, cocoa, and buttered toast deliver a creamy finish.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Insider","year":"2017","ratingOutOf100":86}]}
