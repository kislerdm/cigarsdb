The presentation is striking and unusual. The word Davidoff does not appear on the cigar, which is devoid of a traditional cigar band. Instead, the cigars have narrow golden foot bands with beading on the edge, bearing the name of the cigar size in subtle, embossed relief type. Each cigar has a tight pigtail cap.","specializedRatings":[{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2016","ratingOutOf100":84},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2015","ratingOutOf100":86},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2012","ratingOutOf100":90},{"who":"Cigar Aficionado","year":"2010","ratingOutOf100":88}]}
