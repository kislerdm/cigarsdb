Fifty percent of that filler is comprised of Ligero leaf, surrounded by a Corojo wrapper. The cigar is medium in strength but full flavored. The Dominican blend with an Ecuadorian Corojo wrapper is just an excellent combination. We named the cigar after our new corporate office and warehouse address, 231 Rock Hill Rd. in Bala Cynwyd, PA."}
