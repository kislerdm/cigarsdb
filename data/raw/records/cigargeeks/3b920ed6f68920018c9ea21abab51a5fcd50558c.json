Included in those fillers is pelo de oro, the prized golden hair tobacco the Garcías reserve for some of the factory’s most special products.\n\nPelo de oro is a strand of tobacco that is banned in Cuba due to its propensity to mold. While it’s relatively uncommon, the tobacco is a staple of the My Father Limited Edition Series.\n\nAs with other releases, each cigar has a secondary band and is packaged in coffins. Pricing is set at $24 and it is limited to 2,500 boxes of 14 cigars\n\nhttps://halfwheel.com/my-father-10th-anniversary-limited-edition-2018-arrives-in-stores/282875"}
