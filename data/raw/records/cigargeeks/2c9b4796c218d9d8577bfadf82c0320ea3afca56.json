This leaf is smooth and dry to the touch, but loaded with charismatic flavors. Inside, an aged blend of Cuban-seed Nicaraguan long-leaf tobaccos resides, ready to unleash a delicious array of flavor. Rich and smooth, 5 Vegas Miami is spicy off the bat, only to become tamed by a soothing bouquet of earthy and leathery undertones. The medium-body gradually becomes more full towards the finish, completing a savory and satisfying smoke."}
