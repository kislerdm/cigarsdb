Rated 91 by Cigar Aficionado, Viejo is considered to among Rolandoâ€™s finest creations. The combination of vintage Sumatra maduro wrappers and Cuban-seed long-fillers from Nicaragua, Brazil, and the Dominican offers a bold, yet well-balanced level of flavor. Thanks to 6 solid years of aging, these Viejos dish out a rich, medium-bodied bouquet dominated by pleasant, earthy undertones."}
