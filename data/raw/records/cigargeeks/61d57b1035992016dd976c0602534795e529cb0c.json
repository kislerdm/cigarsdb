It’s no secret that the Aganorsa farms are known for growing some of the best tobacco in the world. Legendary blender Arsenio Ramos gathered Chandito and Jacinto, his team of Cuban Masters, to blend Aganorsa tobacco leaf from the Jalapa Valley’s famed La Mia farm (once owned by the Somoza family), with one leaf of Criollo ‘98 from the Aganorsa farm in Esteli. All La Mia cigars are rolled using the traditional entubado style with two binders and wrapped with a Corojo ’99 Rosado wrapper finished with a traditional triple cap and flag head. The La Mia Farm is considered to be one the finest farms in all of Nicaragua. The La Mia cigar will be the first time tobacco from these fields will be used to create a cigar since the farms were acquired by Eduardo Fernandez from the Nicaraguan government. Rumor has it even the Cuban government had its eye on this outstanding farm, with its unique rich terroir that produces outstanding tobacco. La Mia cigars are a boutique small batch production rolled by Cuban Torcedores in Miami. The number of boxes will vary from year to year depending on the availability of tobacco needed to make this unique cigar."}
