This cigar comes in at a very unique 6x41 vitola and features a Connecticut Shade wrapper over Nicaraguan filler and binders. Privada Champagne No.1 was a favorite of many because of the surprising level of complexity packed into a slender Connecticut Shade wrapped cigar, and Privada Jouët certainly delivers the same levels of complexity, but with flavors that are totally unique when compared to its predecessor. Additionally, while this is the second cigar to be released in the Privada Champagne Series, this was actually the first cigar in the series to be rolled, and is now over a year aged. Privada Jouët was rolled at the very well- known and celebrated REDACTED factory in Nicaragua.\""}
