In a pleasant working atmosphere each individual cigar is given full attention by our experienced staff.\n\n\"Casa de Alegria\" is a blend of Cuban seed tobaccos from the best growing areas of Nicaragua. We process tobacco from the regions of Jalapa, Esteli and Condega. Much of the tobacco used is fermented by ourselves over a period of about 12 months. We use the leaves as inlay or  wrapper tobacco in our compositions (leagues). \n\nWe offer aromatic and balanced cigars in the two series \"Suave\" and \"Rico\". While the \"Suave\" cigars can be assigned to the attributes of mild and creamy, \"Rico\" cigars are characterized by full-bodied flavors of cocoa and nuts with a balanced sweetness, strenght: medium-strong . \n\nFor the smoke in between we offer the series \"Rosa de Nicaragua\". A mediumfillerblend  from our own tobacco is rounded off by an Indonesian wrapper. The latter gives the cigar a subtle natural sweetness. \n\n\nCasa de Alegria produces cigars in accordance with the key principles of fair trade. This means Casa de Alegria: \n\n* Purchases  tobacco from the grower after harvest, so the farmer can calculate his own profit margin. \n* Pays wages above average  \n* Contributes to the social and health insurance of our employees and their relatives with access to private hospitals."}
