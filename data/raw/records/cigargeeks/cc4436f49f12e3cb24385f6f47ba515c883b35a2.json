A few months back, a certain very loud internet retailer, placed a huge order for Tesoro Cubanoâ€¦ and backed out when it came time to pay. TADA-DA-DA, Thompson to the rescue! When we heard about Jose's unfortunate situation, we flew down to the Dominican Republic and bought every bundle of Tesoro Cubano at a healthy (but fair) discount. Tesoro Cubano is a medium bodied, mixed filler Dominican smoke with a rich Sumatra binder."}
