This blend can't have Cuban tobacco in it. U.S. Laws prohibit the use of Cuban tobacco in blends for U.S. Consumption. So what is it? The La Mezcla Cubana cigar is handmade in the Dominican Republic and claims to use an all Nicaraguan blend of tobacco including gorgeous wrapper. The La Mezcla Cubana blend is medium bodied in strength but is subtly complex to the trained palate. There is a lot going on here and possibly more than meets the eye. The The La Mezcla Cubana ash, and the burn is outstanding grab a box of the La Mezcla Cubana cigars you will love them and you can't be the price."}
