The idea behind Fifty/Fifty is to offer the ability to enjoy two different flavor profiles while smoking the same cigar. Fifty/Fifty's components are a closely-guarded secret, but two distinct blends were formulated to make up the cigar. Joining the two blends was a challenge that was difficult to perfect. Each cigars is carefully crafted taking triple the amount of time a normal cigar takes to roll. The cigar comes wrapped in a dark, oily Nicaraguan cover leaf with two binders holding the filler in place. Fifty/Fifty starts out as a rich medium bodied cigar before transitioning into a bold, full-bodied smoke. This is a first for the industry we know you will enjoy!"}
