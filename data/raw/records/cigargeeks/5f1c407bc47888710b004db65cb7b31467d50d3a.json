The Liga Privada is a medium-bodied, limited release cigar and features seven different tobaccos from four countries including a filler of two Nicaraguan secos, some Honduran Jamastran, and two Nicaraguan ligeros.  All of this bound by a Brazilian mata fina binder and a gorgeous, high priming CT Broadleaf Maduro wrapper. It took 9 tries to get the blend just right, hence the number 9 designation."}
