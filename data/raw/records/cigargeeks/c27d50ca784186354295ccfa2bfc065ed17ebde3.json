There are a ton of Cuban immigrants in this business, but it is pretty cool to see a one-man show that really has not been here very long take a piece of the market for himself. Watch our interview with him on YouTube. He dodged the law and communism to be here and his cigars are made with a knowledge and spirit of Cuba. Noel is a tobacco philosopher with roots in the old world and branches in the new one. This cigar won awards with the lancero format and Noel wanted Privada members to have a size of their own. KSG stands for King of the Small Gauge. Let’s enjoy this cigar together and show our gratitude for Señor Rojas’s work!\""}
