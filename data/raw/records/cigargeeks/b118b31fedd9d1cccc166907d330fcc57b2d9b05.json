After the huge success of the limited edition Rocky Patel Fusion cigars, Rocky himself decided to grace cigar lovers with the even more flavorful Rocky Patel Fusion Double Maduro. The Fusion Double Maduro is one of the first cigar blends to use two impeccable wrapper leaves, while most brands use just one wrapper. The first wrapper leaf is a robust Brazilian Mata Fina that covers an immensely flavorful Nicaraguan Habano Maduro wrapper. The entire blend, along with the specially aged Dominican and Nicaraguan tobaccos, offers a remarkably delicious, chocolatey, toasted smoke that is super smooth on your taste buds and delivers the most mouth-watering aroma imaginable"}
