The cigars sat in a warehouse in Naples, FL for about 3 years and then shipped to us. We have been sitting on these since we moved into our new warehouse 3 years ago. I have to be honest, I did not like this cigar originally. I had been told about the amazing processes and tobaccos used in it, but again, I held them for another 2.5 years because I was not initially wowed. That is, until recently, when one Saturday morning I was perusing the warehouse to find something to smoke, I stumbled across the coolers. I noticed an aroma that was very peated, reminding me of Ardbeg Scotch when I opened them. Iâ€™m rarely wrong about how cigars will age, but I was wrong about this one! This cigar is a testament to professional aging and how much it can allow a cigar to develop when done correctly.\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/product/the-200-aged-6-years/"}
