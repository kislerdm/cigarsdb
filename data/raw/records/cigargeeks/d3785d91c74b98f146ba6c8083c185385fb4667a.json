This results in typically sweet, dense logs of concentrated Dominican tobacco. These \"logs\" are then combined with a Connecticut shade binder and a filler blend of Honduran tobacco from the Jamastran Valley, Nicaraguan tobacco from Estel√≠ and some Dominican Piloto Cubano and encases it all inside of dark Connecticut broadleaf wrapper.\n\nhttps://www.smallbatchcigar.com/cao-arcana-mortal-coil"}
