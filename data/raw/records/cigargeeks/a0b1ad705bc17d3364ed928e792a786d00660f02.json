This smooth cigar is a perfect blend of Dominican Republic Piloto Cubano and Condega leaf. The Condega region has more cloud cover, and rockier soil than other regions in the Dominican Republic, leading to a thinner leaf, and a less potent flavor. The binder is a northern Nicaraguan binder to continue the smoothness. All skillfully wrapped in a flavorful and hearty San Andreas wrapper.\n\nhttps://doumittcigar.com/product/d-8-5-pack/"}
