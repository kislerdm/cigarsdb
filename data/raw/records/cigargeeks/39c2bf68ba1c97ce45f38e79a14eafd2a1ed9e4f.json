Mojitos and Mambos and writhing twenty somethings; this is the Havana that once was. Hot bodies and cool smoking cigars. Oh, how I long for the good ol’ days. How much longer must I wait? I’m ready to return, but until there’s a regime change and the long-closed gate reopens, I’ll have to be content with the next best thing, chilling out with A Night in Havana cigar with its all-Criollo tobaccos.\n\nA Night in Havana cigar is your ticket to the temporal delights of old Havana. Who knows? It’s the Havana that may never be again. But this cigar is so artfully crafted that you’ll think you’re back on the Malecón with your sweetheart on your arm without a care in the world. Our rating for A Night in Havana is 90, and its pleasure index is A+ all the way.\n\nWe invite you to swing one of two ways with A Night in Havana.
