This is made in Costa Rica at the same factory that makes the FAKE CUBANS. It is 100% illegal to sell Cuban tobacco. There are a few brands based out of Costa Rica and their claim to fame has been this mysterious rumor that they are made with Cuban tobacco. Is there any way to confirm this? No, but I have been assured that if you took a Cuban cigar, took the wrapper leaf off of it and replaced it with a CT shade wrapper, this is exactly what it would taste like. Meanwhile, it's better than any Cuban I have ever smoked, hands down. This may go in my top 3 for 2020. This actually may go in my top 10 of all time?  I'm asking myself this question out loud. Now when I smoked it like a regular cigar I thought it was good, not great. But when I sat down alone with it, in a cool garage and took my time with it, it was pure bliss. We need to seriously thank @espinosacigars for allowing us the honor to put this in the club.  DO NOT talk about what it might be, not even to the manufacturer. Mums the word on this one, no exceptions.\""}
