This age-old method ensures open chambers of air flow from the foot to the head of the cigar.  The ligero tobacco, which lends the cigar its unique full body, are bunched independently and then placed into the center of the remaining ‘entubar’ rolled filler blend.  This ‘channel’ of ligero  tobacco ranges the full length of the cigar and extends ¼” beyond the finished trimmed foot, creating a startlingly unique ‘fuse like’ appearance that assures a superior draw, flawless conical burn with a long white ash, and a myriad of complex flavors channeled directly onto the palate.  ENTUBAR®  QUAD MADURO is ‘cuadrado’ pressed Habano and comprised of all Cuban-seed Nicaraguan (viso and ligero) and Dominican (seco) fillers, a savory Nicaraguan binder, and skillfully enveloped in a rich, dark Jalapa Valley-grown Maduro wrapper crop aged eight years in seasoned oak barrels."}
