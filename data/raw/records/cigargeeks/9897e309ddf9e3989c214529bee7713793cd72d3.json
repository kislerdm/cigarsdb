This significant collaboration means that Privada Cigar Club members can enjoy high quality cigars, which usually retail for around $50 each, as part of their subscription boxes. These cigars are made from special tobaccos exclusive to Costa Rica—a country notorious for its expensive and complex cigar production process. Owing to Costa Rica’s unique climate and altitude, the cigars must undergo a minimum of three months of post-production aging. We chose to wait 1 year, making them remarkably rare. Each cigar is carefully crafted, incorporating the finest Ecuadorian Habano wrapper and binder, which envelop the special Especial tobaccos. As a result of this exclusive arrangement, Privada Cigar Club members are undoubtedly experiencing some of the best cigars available on the market.\""}
