A combination of Nicaraguan, Brazilian, and Dominican fillers with a Dominican Olor binder make this cigar a medium bodied taste sensation. Pressing for 48 hours ensures the flavors marry in the traditional Cuban fashion. A minimum of six months aging after the five-year-old tobaccos are rolled makes them the most unique and delicious cigars in our line."}
