If someone had proposed this five years ago, I would have found it hard to believe. Yet here we are, releasing the 7th cigar in a series crafted by AJ as a tribute to my favorite director, Wes Anderson. The 6th cigar for the LCA is ready, but we believe “The Field Scout,” inspired by the aesthetics of the movie Moonrise Kingdom, might be the crown jewel of the series. It serves as a testament to AJ’s unparalleled ability to create impeccable cigars.\""}
