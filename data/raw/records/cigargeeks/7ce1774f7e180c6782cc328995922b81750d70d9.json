Apparently Rocky started developing this cigar back in 2002 and then took a break from it to develop his famous Vintage series. After Rocky finished his Vintage series, he started developing a Sun Grown line from scratch. These Original Sun Growns were the ones that were left over and are totally different than the RP Sun Growns we all know and love today."}
