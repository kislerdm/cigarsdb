A golf brand and cigar company that focuses on the game of golf. This brand has been in the works for over 2 years. It is a family owned company of 3 generations of golf and cigar lovers. In time, they will make everything from golf balls, to tees, to golf and lifestyle clothing. The family wanted to create the cigar, then build their entire brand around that cigar. They have worked for years, tirelessly trying to find the correct blend that can be manufactured year after year with great pleasure and, as importantly, consistency. When I was first approached them about this cigar I was not very interested. Then I smoked it. I must admit, Iâ€™m not a golfer, but if I was, I imagine this would be the stick I take out on the course with me. The main thing I love about this brand is that the cigar is the foundation of the company. Everything else will be built around it. That is pretty cool. The cigar is of interest to me because it offers a full body approach to a balanced flavor. Not easy to do. Enjoy the Gilligan Golf Churchill and get ready for a superb smoking experience.\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/gilligan-golf-churchill-original/"}
