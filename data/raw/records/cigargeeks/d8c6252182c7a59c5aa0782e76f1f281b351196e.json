The cigar of the Summer of â€™22.  You have it.  And only you.  Privada members are the only people who have access to these cigars, so share them wisely.  After receiving this cigar sample I knew a few things.  The first being I was reminded of pungent cedar and dried mangos.  Amazing.  The second thing I knew was that this cigar was not made by any blender we work with.  I also felt as though the cigar was aged a bit.  Not a ton, but just enough to ripen.  Turns out I was right.  The cigars have been aged at the factory for a year and in our possession for about 6 months.  The cigar was also made by a factory worker who actually rolls cigars, not their normal blender.  The story goes that this is the cigar he would roll for himself.  Not uncommon in cigar factories.  What is uncommon is that this is the only cigar he smokes.  I thought that was cool.  His name is Angel and the factory is called Tabacalera Tolupan and is based in Honduras.  We have never worked with them in the past, but I certainly hope to get more cigars like this in the future from them.  This cigar embodies what is possible in regards to flavor out of Honduras.  Spectacular.  Summer vibes on this one for sure.  We took extra time to dress these up so they did not fly under your radar.
