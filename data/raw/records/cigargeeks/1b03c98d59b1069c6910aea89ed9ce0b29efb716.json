Unfiltered.  Off kilter.  Not always right, but certainly passionate.  This is my take on Ernesto Padilla.  Please form your own opinion of the man.  You can get a great glimpse into who he is and what he believes by watching the interview we did of him on our YouTube channel.  I use the term interview lightly because we basically just set him loose on camera.  In the end, for me, he’s the relative you love but don’t always like.  But one thing about him is not up for debate.  He makes a GREAT cigar.  For this installment, we see Ernesto back in the Raices Cubanas factory which is where we met him.  Honduras, home to some of the best tobacco in the world.  The cigar you are about to smoke is some of Padillas’ most flavorful work.  There are notes in this cigar I found hard to translate into words.  Prepare to experience Padilla, Catcher in the Rye.  A Privada exclusive cigar.\"\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/padilla-catcher-in-the-rye/"}
