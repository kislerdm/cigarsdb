This was originally branded as Metapa but changed to Aksum shortly after release due to copyright issues.  Color is supposedly claro but these can be hard to differentiate from the maduro blend when side by side.  The maduro is a little on the light side on color and the claro is really a colorado type color, and there is no distinguishment in the bands between the blends.\n\nhttps://atlanticcigar.com/aksum-claro-by-foundation-robusto-5x50/"}
