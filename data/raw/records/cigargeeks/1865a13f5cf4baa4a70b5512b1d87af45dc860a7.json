To recap, Archive is a group of Japanese whiskey lovers that go around the world curating and distilling private barrels. About 5 years ago, they delved into the art of cigar and whiskey pairing. Since then, they have made contacts with some of the best cigar manufacturers in the world. Iâ€™m talking about AJ, Raices, EPC and the list goes on. One of them joined Privada about 3 years ago. We spoke online for some time and then they revealed an opportunity. They wanted to start curating and aging cigars for specific barrels of whiskey. The issue was taxes and costs. Getting cigars into Japan is majorly expensive. So we made a deal, every once in a while they would extend opportunities to me to pick up the slack and take the bulk of the cigars. All I have to do is pay for them and import them. After the last release broke the internet, I have been patiently waiting. This happens once, maybe twice a year, and the last run had too few cigars for us. So when I got this call I knew I would be a hero! I aim to serve you all the best cigars in the world, and I think we just found a winner.\""}
