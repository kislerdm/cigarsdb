Instead, the cigar fits perfectly into the Camacho portfolio with big, bold flavors while at the same time toning down some of the legendary strength for which the brand is known. To pull off this feat, the cigar’s filler is rolled from a perfectly blended and robust mix of Dominican Aleman Ligero and proprietary Honduran Generoso tobaccos punched up with a spicy Corojo binder before being tempered with the cool, creamy Ecuadorian Connecticut wrapper."}
