In 2014, AVO Cigars brought back all of the AVO Limited Edition cigars from 2001 through 2014 as a part of the AVO’s Greatest Hits sampler collection. One cigar was that was not part of that collection was the AVO LE05. At the time, Master Blenders Eladio Diaz and Henke Kelner could not re-create the blend up to the same standards as the original 2005 release, so it was left out.\n\nAfter some time the duo has got the blend to a point where they deem it can be re-released. It returns with the same components, featuring an Ecuadorian wrapper over Dominican binder and filler. It’s available in one size – a 5 3/8 x 52 Robusto Extra.\n\nhttps://cigar-coop.com/2018/09/cigar-news-avo-le05-returns-for-30th-anniversary.html"}
