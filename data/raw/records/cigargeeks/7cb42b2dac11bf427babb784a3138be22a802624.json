I’ll never be able to tell you what it was, but I can tell you what it is now: the WAVY WAFER. I could have done a ghost series with this but man oh man, that name kept calling me every time I smoked it. Although chocolate syrup is the dominant flavor for me, there was always this reminder of a waffle cone or a vanilla wafer. These are the finest San Andres wrappers with the best Nicaraguan tobaccos. How could we go wrong? This cigar is a testament to the uniqueness and flavor of Aganorsa tobacco. Aged almost 1 year, the cigar is truly ripe and ready to smoke. Remember, this is a legendary blend and we are lucky to get this in our box! Shout out to Aganorsa on social media!\""}
