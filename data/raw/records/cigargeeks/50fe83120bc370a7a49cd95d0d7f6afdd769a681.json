BANG! This is an alert. This cigar is like smoking the best spicy orange chicken from a greasy Chinese food restaurant. I know!! About 2 years ago, Kristoff released this cigar in a variety of sizes. One of those sizes got a very high rating on some review sites. I never smoked it, but I could tell based on the reviews that there was something to this cigar. The smallest ring gauge at the time was a 44. It also seemed that the smaller the ring gauge, the higher the review scores kept going. So I called in a favor. Make it for the club in a LANCERO. They actually said, “that could be dangerous.” I replied, “that’s a risk I’m willing to take.” Hence the nickname GUNPLAY. Only Privada members will have this cigar. It is possibly my favorite cigar of the year thus far. It uses a blend of San Andres wrapper from Mexico, a binder from Indonesia, and fillers from Nicaragua. 9 months to a year ago they arrived. We smoked them and hated them. What a mistake, I thought. Now after 9 months of rest, we smoked it again last night and were blown away. Sometimes a cigar just needs a little rest. PLEASE shout out Kristoff on social media for doing us this solid!\""}
