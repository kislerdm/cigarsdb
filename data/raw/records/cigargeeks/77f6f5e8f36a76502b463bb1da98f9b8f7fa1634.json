The Los Hermanos cigar is blended using the finest Nicaraguan tobacco from legendary Cuban master grower Arsenio Ramos and his tobacco dream team he assembled from Cuba’s best. In 2009, four of the Top 25 Cigars rated by Cigar Aficionado all came from the Raices Cubanas cigar factory. The makers behind legendary brands like Viaje \u0026 Illusione, this factory has been building a reputation as a maker of some of the world’s top crafted cigars. All Los Hermanos cigars are made from first generation Corojo ’99, Criollo ’98 seeds, wrapped with a grade one Café Colorado wrapper, and finished with a traditional triple cap. This small production blend has been in the works for some time now, sorting the very best tobaccos to assure a consistent full bodied smoke with loads of flavor. All of the Los Hermanos cigars are made in small-batch quantities once a year to maintain quality and consistency, the number of boxes will vary from year to year based on the availability of the tobacco needed to make this wonderful cigar.  http://www.atlanticcigar.com/cigars/Los-Hermanos-Cigars.asp?aff=5125"}
