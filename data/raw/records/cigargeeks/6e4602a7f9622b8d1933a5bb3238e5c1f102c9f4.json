Upmann brand changed from a genuine African Cameroon wrapper to a new form of Connecticut-seed wrapper called TBN, which was being grown successfully in Indonesia. (TBN should never be confused with the awful wrapper that came from that country during the Cigar Boom era. TBN, in fact, is the wrapper used on todayâ€™s hot-selling Romeo y Julieta 1875 line.) These smokes are, like the Cameroon versions of earlier years, test cigars that were used to monitor the consistency of the H. Upmann brand to assure the same taste and aroma year after year. I have only found these at JR Cigars."}
