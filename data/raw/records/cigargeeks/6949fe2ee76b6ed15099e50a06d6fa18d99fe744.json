They are medium in body and strength, and sport a smooth, oily, burgundy colored Ecuadorian wrapper. These are made by Perdomo, and have many rich flavors like cinnamon and coffee throughout. These stay cool all the way to the end, and have a pleasant aroma both before and after lighting. The construction and burn are practically flawless."}
