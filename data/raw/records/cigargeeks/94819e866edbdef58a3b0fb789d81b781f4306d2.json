While the Evil Eye offers wisdom and premonition, the Hamsa wards off evil spirits, making them a perfect pair. This cigar, aged for a year, showcases the craftsmanship of Guillermo Peña’s factory. American Connecticut Broadleaf wrappers are rare and usually pricey, but we’ve managed to include this gem in our club. With each puff, you’ll experience what makes the Broadleaf so popular and why Estelí, Nicaragua, is considered the new Havana. This cigar is nothing short of fantastic, providing a journey through Guillermo’s factory with every draw.\"\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/product/hamsa-the-hand/"}
