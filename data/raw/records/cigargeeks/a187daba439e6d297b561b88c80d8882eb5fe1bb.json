They told me a gentleman from Detroit, MI had ordered cigars from them and then disappeared. The odd thing is he left a deposit. It had been 3 years that the cigars were sitting in storage. Since half had already been paid for in advance, payment was not a priority. But business was good and they needed all the space they could get. Who do they call? Us! I asked to try the cigars, and a few weeks later I had them in hand. The same cigar you have in your hand right now. I have no idea what the band is about, but I do know that Gratiot Ave in Detroit was once considered the Little Italy of Detroit. Today it is unfortunately a very dangerous and dreary place. My goal is to take some of the proceeds from the cigar and donate them to a local charity. It won’t solve all the problems there, but maybe we’ll help clothe some kids or feed some families. I’ll make it happen and it will be worth it. Aside from doing a good deed, these cigars are straight BANGERS!! We know about the blend too: It’s a Sumatra, baby! And it’s dark and savory. This cigar is magic and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Let’s also hope that the person who paid to have these made does not appear out of thin air and wants something in return!\""}
