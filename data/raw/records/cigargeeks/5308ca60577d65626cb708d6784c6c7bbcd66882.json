This is the pre-release version of that cigar. Only 10,000 were made and we have most of that stock. You should see this on shelves one day soon but the band will change. The cigar is named after the grandmother of the two brothers who started the company. She lived to be 108 years old and smoked at least one cigar every single day of her life! Stories like this are why I started the club. The cigar is a 6 x 54 box-pressed toro. The wrapper is Mexican San Andres over a Brazilian binder and Dominican and Nicaraguan fillers. The company says the Dominican tobaccos were grown by Jochy Blanco. The cap style is a hybrid of sorts. It's almost like a regular shaped cigar (Parejo), but it has characteristics of a belicoso.\"\n\nNow in the PCC shop:\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/blackbird-idalia-108-toro/"}
