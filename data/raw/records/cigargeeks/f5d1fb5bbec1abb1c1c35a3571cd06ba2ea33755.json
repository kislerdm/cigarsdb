Originally introduced by Carlos Tora√±o in the late 1980's, Vueltabajo cigars offer superb construction, easy draw and rich flavor in an affordably-priced selection. Oily, Ecuadorian Connecticut wrappers surround a mild to medium-bodied blend of premium Dominican Piloto Cubano fillers. A great value, well worth trying. You might even taste some hints of Old Havana's by-gone era in there."}
