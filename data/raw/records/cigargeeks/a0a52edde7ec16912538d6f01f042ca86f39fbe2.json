It is a light to medium bodied smoke and is savory to the taste buds.  As with every other BOW TIE cigar, this one is completely hand-rolled from all long-filler tobaccos.  Wrapped in an Ecuadorian Sun-Grown wrapper, this cigar completely fulfills the intentions of the master blender that originally created it."}
