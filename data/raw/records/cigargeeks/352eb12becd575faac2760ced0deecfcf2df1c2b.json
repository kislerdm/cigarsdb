I have had these as tubos.  Although now listed as hand-made, I had thought they were mechanizado.\nSweet and dark flavors from the wrapper dominate the medium smoke.\n[Note from Larry: This model is machine-made and tubed, its size is a long corona. Rigoletto makes both hand and machine-made cigars. Londonaire also comes in natural wrapper.]\nI would smoke this cigar if I wasn't smoking something better.  I realize that doesn't sound like a positive, but it is.  Because of the nature of the cigar market, I can beat the $2 price tag of this cigar.  If I was still buying all my smokes at the local news agency, the Rigoletta Londonaire would probably be somewhere in my regular rotation."}
