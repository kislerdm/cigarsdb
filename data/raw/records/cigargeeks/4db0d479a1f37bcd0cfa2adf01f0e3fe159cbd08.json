A maduro wrapper graces this blend....an oily leaf from the famed San Andres Valley of Mexico, concealing a Cuban-seed mixture of long-leaf tobaccos from the Esteli and Jalapa valleys of Nicaragua. Medium-bodied - but complex - Cuban Legacy offers toasty notes of coffee and rich hints of dark chocolate during the burn, while subtle notes of spice enter the fray from time to time. The thick maduro wrapper lends an enjoyable natural sweetness after each puff, completing a rich, medium-bodied and aromatic cigar."}
