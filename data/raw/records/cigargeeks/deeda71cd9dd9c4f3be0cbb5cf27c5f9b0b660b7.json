This is a different blend than the Core Line, according to the page for this one at CI. There is a four year gap between reviews of the core line in 2016 and then some more in 2020 which might indicate that this one wasn't made during that time.  \nhttps://www.cigarsinternational.com/p/puros-indios-cigars/1411836/#p-62795"}
