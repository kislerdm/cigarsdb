Corey Frisbee, a successful entrepreneur, left behind his painting business in 2010 to start a business he was more passionate about. His journey took him to Texas to learn how to hand-roll cigars from a Cuban woman. Corey spent the next few months perfecting his craft. Thousands of cigars later, Corey has built a one-of-a-kind business in historic Weston, Missouri. \n\nOur Cigars\n\nOur cigars are made with Grade A tobacco, sourced from locations around the world. In addition to our own hand-rolled cigars, we offer many top brand cigars. Stop by and we would be happy to introduce you to some great cigars. \n\nwww.westontobacco.com"}
