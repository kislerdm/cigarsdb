As fans of the series have come to expect, the cigar is topped with an exaggerated pigtail/bun head, sitting atop a traditional 109-style cap (essentially a cross between a traditional parejo and a belicoso). The cigars have been hand-crafted at the renowned My Father Cigars factory in Estelí, made under the guidance of Pete Johnson (owner of Tatuaje Cigars) and the legendary García family. The blend includes all-Nicaraguan binder/fillers and a dark shade of Ecuadorian Habano wrapper, creating a punchy profile of black pepper, toasted oak, cinnamon, black coffee, and a lip-smacking raisin sweetness."}
