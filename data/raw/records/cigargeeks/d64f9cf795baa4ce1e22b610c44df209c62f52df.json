It was an instant classic, making top 10 and top 25 lists everywhere. It had a personal impact on me as well. A Connecticut shade perfection of a blend. Now this is not your father's CT shade. This is a new-world blend of Nicaraguan tobacco under one of the more expensive and flawless Connecticut wrappers. It's rolled by the Plasencia family in Nicaragua under the careful eye of the good folks at Crux. Crux is a brand built by a Minneapolis native who, with the help of his partner (also an experienced tobacconist), are making what they believe to be the finest cigars available and out of one of the finest farms in the game. While all things in cigars are subjective, this cigar being absolutely amazing is not. Get ready for the journey of a modern day CT shade in a size made only for Privada! You will not find this anywhere else. It should have a secondary Privada band, but some of the bands were lost at the factory. It's the same cigar either way. I wonder which one makes it more collectible?\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/crux-epicure-lonsdale-privada-aged-just-under-one-year/"}
