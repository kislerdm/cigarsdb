Well, they are back at it again. Now this cigar was not meant to be aged. For some reason we took delivery of it, stored it in our coolers, and nearly forgot about them. It was ready a year ago. Now, with rest, it may be even better. First, there isn't much of a story, other than James Agopian, the company's founder, heard the lyrics in an old disco song or something. Great story. Now, let's take a look at the foot of this cigar. Candela. Candela was the most popular cigar wrapper from the time of the Cuban embargo until about 1974. Like every cigar was green, not kidding. Check out the Cincinnati Kid movie sometime and you will see what I mean... great film. James hates Candela, yet he chose this for the foot. It gives a sweet grassy note on the beginning that gets balanced out by the rest of the tobaccos. Let's remember that Sinistro rolls in one of the oldest cigar factories in the Dominican Republic: La Aurora. This makes for nearly flawless construction and quality control. The band looks great, too. And this is going to smoke like no Connecticut shade you ever smoked before.\""}
