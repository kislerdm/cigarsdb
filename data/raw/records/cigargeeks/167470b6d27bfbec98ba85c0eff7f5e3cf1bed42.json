'20 subscription box.  The notes that came with it say this:\n\n\"Welcome to another exquisitely aged luxury cigar. This time from another one of the most coveted names in luxury cigars. These guys also use a white band, but their name begins with the letter \"A\". This is their aged maduro. The wrapper is an aged Connecticut Broadleaf over Dominican fillers. This is another brand that gives you the status of smoking luxury items when the band is visible. As for our label, I certainly love this Halloween look. I wonder if we will be able to do this again next year? For now I must bask in the moment of finding this cigar. By far my favorite of the pack, you are about to embark on a journey that will take you to heights of flavor. Rolled by one of the best manufacturers in the world, blended by a careful group of cigar experts, this cigar is pure joy. Save this for a special time. And remember the hard work that goes into finding these gems when you do.\"\n\nMy own notes - based on the clues provided, this is probably the Ashton Aged Maduro in an unreleased vitola that's been sitting in their aging rooms since 2016."}
