'23.\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/product/popeyes-reign-aged-2-years/\n\n\"Deep in Nicaragua, inside a secret Condega factory, there’s a story about Popeye’s Reign. It all started quietly with skilled craftsmen, and there were worries about legal issues. This cigar is proof of their passion and their admiration for what all of us have created here at Privada. This is basically a wraith. It’s a tribute to an iconic brand that’s fiercely guarded. The people who made Popeye’s Reign had to be careful to avoid legal problems while keeping their craft pure. The cigar captures the same bold spirit as Popeye the Sailor Man. Back in 1957, during a famous New York parade, there was a Popeye balloon. Rainwater collected on his sailor’s hat and surprised the people below, just like Popeye’s hearty laugh: Ah-gahgahgahgahgah!\""}
