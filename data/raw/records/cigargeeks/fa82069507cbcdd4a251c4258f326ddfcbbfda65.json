It is believed that Armageddon would overtake the peoples of the world and all creation at this time. On December 14th, be prepared to smoke the last cigar you will ever have: the Tatuaje Apocalypse™.   \nIn a continuing effort to create limited runs of premium cigars blended by the industry’s top manufacturers, Smoke Inn Cigars of South Florida proudly presents its fifth installment of their MicroBlend Series™, the Tatuaje Apocalypse™. The sequel to the highly acclaimed Tatuaje Anarchy™ released December 10, 2010, the Tatuaje Apocalypse™ is smaller in size measuring 5.25” x 48-52. Made at the My Father Factory in Esteli, Nicaragua and dawned with a dark, rich Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper, the Apocalypse was guided by the vision of Pete Johnson. Johnson, along with the Garcia Family, have masterfully tweaked the original blend with such subtlety that the Apocalypse™ is highly reminiscent of the original flavor profile, yet in somewhat of a more concentrated fashion."}
