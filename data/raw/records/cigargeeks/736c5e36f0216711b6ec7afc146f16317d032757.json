Notes that came with it say this: \n\n\"Casdagli's Wide Churchill is our newest Small Batch exclusive! Brought to life while blending for their new Villa Casdagli line. This blend features an exquisite combination of well-aged tobaccos. To begin with, Vlad and Jeremy procured an Ecuadorian Habano Cafe wrapper and an Ecuadorian Habano 2000 binder aged for three years each. Then, they utilized Peruvian Habano, Dominican Criollo, and ligero from Esteli, Nicaragua for filler tobaccos - all aged between three and five years. Production was 3000 cigars total.\"\n\nMy note - I emailed Andrew at Small Batch about why the stick was called a \"churchill\" when it's actually just a robusto gordo, and he said that was Casdagli's name for it and he doesn't know why they chose to call it that.  Also, the stick has a closed foot."}
