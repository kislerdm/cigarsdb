Everything about this line is different for us. The vitolas, the blend style and the wrapper are things we have never done before. I have been working with Pennsylvania tobacco for a while and love its strength and richness. The Pennsylvania tobacco really elevates this cigar to the next level. I wanted something totally different for the vitolas, so we created our own, a slender Salomon with a blunt foot, or what we call a ‘Snub Nose’. This makes Nocturne a very time consuming cigar to make but these vitolas work perfectly with the blend,” explained James Brown, creator of BLTC in a press release."}
