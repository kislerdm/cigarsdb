It was one of three sticks that arrived from Privada Cigar Club in their monthly subscription box.  The notes that came with it say this:\n\n\"This is a maduro from Honduras. It is roughly 6 x 50. The wrapper is Mexican San Andres while the binder is Brazilian and the fillers are Dominican, Honduran, and Nicaraguan. It comes from a prestigious factory in Honduras where about 11,000 of them have been sitting for four years now. They would not tell us what cigar this was, only that it had been very popular about 4 years ago. Archive wanted 5,000 and wanted us to take the rest. After assessing the situation and realizing how cool this opportunity was, I took the remaining cigars.\"\n\n(Archive is a cigar club in Japan.)"}
