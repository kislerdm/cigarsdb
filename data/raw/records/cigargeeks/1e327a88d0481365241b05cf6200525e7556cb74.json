I can hear Pacino yelling it now. We are big time now. I never mention it but Aganorsa, the LARGEST grower of Cuban Seed tobacco in Nicaragua, loves us. Shout out to Terrence Reilly and the Fernandez Family, as well as Cousin Paul Palmer for hooking us up always. This tobacco is used in Padron, Illusione, formerly My Father and the list goes on. After getting to know this amazing family and company they have allowed us the opportunity to smoke legends. This, my friends, will be one of them, I’m calling it now. Babe Ruth at the plate. WE get the best damn cigars in the game and it shows. This entire box has been composed of Cuban seed premium tobacco grown in the region that has been dubbed the New Cuba, Esteli and surrounding areas of Nicaragua. This is the soil, this is the leaf. The most flavorful all around tobacco the world has to offer right now, and fermented properly too. What else can I say but thank you Aganorsa and we should all be grateful. We have come a long way and still have a long way to go, but it’s moments like this when I smoke this and feel like we can celebrate for a moment. From our hard work to your home, enjoy!\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/aganorsa-la-radiante-nacionale-aged-1-year/"}
