El Centurion is the result of a careful selection of leaves grown of Cuban seeds, which have been matured for three years under the strictest conditions of industry standards. In this process, two varieties of plants from Nicaragua have been used: Criollo 98 and Corojo 99. It is a Medium to Full Bodied cigar and one of the most exquisite ones you have ever tasted. Another by the master himself Jose Pepin Garcia."}
