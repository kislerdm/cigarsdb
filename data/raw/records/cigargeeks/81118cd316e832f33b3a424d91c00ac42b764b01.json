A factory where quality control ridiculously rigorous. That’s a good thing, but it leaves the factory with a healthy load of seconds. These ‘seconds’ or Factory Selects are labeled as such because they have been rejected strictly for cosmetic reasons - cigars with construction issues never see the light of day. The wrappers are a little splotchy or have a slight discoloration there, but the blends are exactly the same….and naturally the price is far less."}
