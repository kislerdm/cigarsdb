The tobacco used for our cigars is carefully selected from the best tobacco regions in the world. Line J is the first in the row. This line of cigars consists of four formats, in honor of the classic cigars made throughout history. Although some sizes are not as popular as Corona and Lancero, these are a return to the classics that passionate fans should not forget. Pyramid and Robusto are the standard of the new times. Although modern trends promote the largest cigars, for several decades these two formats have been included among the classic shapes. The Despot J Cigars line celebrates the classics and all that has been part of the tradition of enjoying cigars for decades.\n\nAll cigars in the J series are made from the same blend that consists of the most sought-after and the most prized leaves among manufacturers in the New World. We’ve spent years researching blends and the origin of tobacco in some of the New World’s most popular cigars, and this is our choice for the Despot J Cigars line.\n\nhttps://www.despotcigars.com/"}
