Just kidding :)\nHowever, we did make this blend to honor a Rottweiler, so there is definitely some “muscle” in this cigar. But we have paid special attention to developing good, rich character in this smoke, just as we have with him.\n\n The Ache blend is a very clean smoke with a beautiful white ash. This blend is bright \u0026 crisp \u0026 very clean. It is playfully spicy on your palate. Originally created in the light \u0026 creamy Connecticut Shade Wrapper, this cigar is an excellent afternoon or evening smoke.\n\nAche is very popular among our local VIP's and so is his blend."}
