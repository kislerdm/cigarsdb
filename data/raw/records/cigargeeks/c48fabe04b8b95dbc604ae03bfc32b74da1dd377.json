No indeed, because of its smaller size, the cigarillo is an even harder puro to make. In fact, the more enlightened manufacturers often train their women torcedores to work exclusively on cigarillos. They know that in addition to their smaller hands, women usually display greater patience as they work with lesser quantities of tobacco to produce cigarillos that draw as smoothly as the larger sizes.\n\nSuch is the case with these Dominican cigarillos. Hand rolled in the Dominican Republic to the most exacting standards, these short smokes use the same high quality tobaccos as are found in premium cigars. Therefore, the smoking pleasure they produce is every bit as pronounced as that found in the larger sizes. So whether you select the Cigarillo Pequeño or the Cigarillo Grande, you’re getting superior flavor in a short smoke. They’re packed 100 smokes to the box."}
