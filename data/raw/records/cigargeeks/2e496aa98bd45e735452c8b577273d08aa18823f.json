Otherwise known as Brooklyn. Home to Biggie Smalls. Ex Bad Boy record execs wanted to pay homage to the late, great, Christopher Wallace by honoring him with his own cigar. And what better way to do it than to don it with the most classic medallion of all time, the Jesus Piece. This has to be one of the nicest cigar bands I have ever seen. What’s more is that the cigar may be the best 60 ring gauge I have ever smoked. For now, they want to leave the factory a mystery. I personally would like to know, because whoever made this cigar is a legend in my mind. I do know the cigar has both Nicaraguan and Dominican as well as an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper. People argue if BIG was the best rapper. That is irrelevant here. The question now becomes, is this the best 60 ring gauge ever? I’ll let you decide. This cigar is a testament to my work in procuring the best and most unique smoking experiences available. Enjoy.\""}
