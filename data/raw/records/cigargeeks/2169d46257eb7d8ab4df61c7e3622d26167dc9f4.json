There is a very well-known brand in our industry with a very well-known blender behind it and he wants anonymity. After you are in this business for a while, you hear it all. They used to be good. Their new line is just okay. That guy got lucky. So on, and so forth. So, we have been sworn to secrecy and are happy to oblige. This is the chance for said blender to see if he is resting on his laurels, or if he is as good as he thinks he is. I will give no more information other than that. I have to say the style of art is totally different from what you may expect from the original blend. The brand was named or inspired by one of my favorite shows, Mr. Robot. Great show! So, if you love it, shout out @mrrobotcigars and let them know if they are onto something with this! #weareprivada\""}
