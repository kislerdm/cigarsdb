A beautifully wrapped stogie and large ring gauge provides for a long sublime burn. Perfect light to medium when it comes to draw, and produces a very tight ash. Starts off medium bodied and quickly turns mild. Cool burning. When you want to relax and take in the dayâ€™s events this Private Label fits the bill! Nice rich tobacco flavor with a very clean finish."}
