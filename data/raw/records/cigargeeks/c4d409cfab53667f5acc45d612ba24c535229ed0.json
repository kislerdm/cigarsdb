This month, retailers have begun to receive the Kristoff TAA Exclusive 49 – a large 7 1/2 x 56 salomon release.\n\nThis is the first Kristoff cigar branded with the TAA name on it, however this is not Kristoff’s first go-around with the TAA. In 2013, the Kristoff 685 Woodlawn was offered first to members of the TAA before being sold widely.  Two years later, Kristoff took the same approach with the Kristoff Classic Reserva as it was offered to TAA members first.\n\nThe cigar features a Honduran Criollo wrapper, Dominican binder, and Dominican and Nicaraguan tobacco in the filler. The 7 1/2 x 56 salomons are packaged ten per box.\n\nThe “49” stands for the fact that 2017 is the 49th anniversary of the TAA as an organization. Like the majority of the 2017 TAA Exclusive Series, this cigar was released with very little marketing push behind it.\nThe Kristoff TAA Exclusive 49 is available in one size – a 7 1/2 x 56 Salomon."}
