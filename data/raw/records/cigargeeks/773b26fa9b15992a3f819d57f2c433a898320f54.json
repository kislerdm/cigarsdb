These Torpedos are totally handmade, extensively aged, and have a smooth medium-bodied taste. Tony's big Torpedo has a well-balanced complex taste with notes of sweet and earthy nuts, cream, raw cocoa, chocolate, and wood. The wrapper is an exquisite Cuban-seed sun-grown Habano leaf and the binder and pure long fillers are finely cured Cuban-seed Habano tobacco. Tony Alvarez personally supervises each cigar roller in the creation of these big Torpedo cigars and some are even made by the man himself. Each Torpedo cigar is 6 inches long with a ring gauge of 54.\nhttps://cccrafter.com/tony-alvarez-habano-big-torpedo-6-x-54-cigars/"}
