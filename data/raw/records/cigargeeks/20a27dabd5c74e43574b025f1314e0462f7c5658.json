The cigars cost $12 each and come packaged in boxes of 12. In keeping with the Nordic theme, the Churchill is called Brísingamen, named after the goddess Freyja’s famous necklace, which, according to the myth, serves as her main source of power. \n\nThe blend is a Habano-seed Ecuadoran wrapper with a Dominican Corojo binder and a mix of Corojo, Criollo ’98 and Piloto Cubano filler from the Dominican Republic. All the Dominican tobacco was grown by Jochy Blanco. The brand is made at Blanco’s Tabacalera Palma in the Dominican Republic as well. Viktorsson added that Freyja 12 is a regular-production cigar."}
