James, the blender, and Coleman, the muscle. These guys do everything together. James lives most of the year in the Dominican Republic where he recently had his first child. Coleman lives in Pittsburgh (shout out!) where he runs the distribution. I often joke with them about their relationship. I like to bust their chops and they are good sports of course. But I was going through their portfolio of blends and band art about a year ago and what did I see? The band you are holding on this cigar. If you know their work, it’s a lot of villain-type stuff. So this really caught my eye. It’s sunny and happy looking. I inquired and they said, “oh you can’t have that. That’s our cigar.” I said “what do you mean?” and he began to tell me that he and Coleman have their own “friendship” cigar. They only smoke it when they do blending sessions and visits to DR together. Of course, I had to try it, and when I did I knew I had to get it for you guys. With the cost of broadleaf and the argument that ensued to open this up to the club, I worked hard to obtain this. I hope you love it!\""}
