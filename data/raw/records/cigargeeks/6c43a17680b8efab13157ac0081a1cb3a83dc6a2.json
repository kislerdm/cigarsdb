It was hard to believe--and unfortunate--that time went by so quickly as I truly enjoyed this premium, mild cigar. Ideal for starters, the Entreprenuer line of cigars had a smooth taste, exquisite aroma, and a clean aftertaste. Its blend of Cibao-grown (the same area within the Dominican Republic where other leading manufacturers such as Arturo Fuente and General Cigar get their tobacco from) Piloto Cubano and Dominican Olor seeds can also be very entertaining to the most demanding cigar connoisseur. Entreprenuer is available in 5 different sizes, including Churchill, Grand Corona, Lonsdale, Toro, Corona, and Robusto"}
