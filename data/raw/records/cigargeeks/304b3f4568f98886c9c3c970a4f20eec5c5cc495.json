That's what we have here - all from the heralded Tabacalera Fernandez, home of AJ Fernandez and his star-studded lineup of top-notch blends. These cigars burn and taste just like the firsts you know and love. Man O' War, Diesel, 5 Vegas Triple-A, San Lotano....you name it. Some are box-pressed, some are round, in a variety of natural, maduro, and Habano blends. All long-filler cigars hand-crafted in typical, top-notch A. Fernandez fashion with first-quality, aged tobaccos."}
