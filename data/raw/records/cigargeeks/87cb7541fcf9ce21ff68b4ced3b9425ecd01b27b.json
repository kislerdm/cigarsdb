The Go West is amazingly flavorful for a mild smoke and you can enjoy this cigar any time of day or night. This blend smokes brilliantly in every single wrapper we have ever paired it with and can be built for you in any ring gauge you desire. It is very popular with the ladies in smaller ring gauges and equally as popular in Churchills for the avid golfer."}
