Its wrapper, binder and filler are highly guarded proprietary secrets. It is medium bodied and hand rolled in the Dominican Republic. It comes in a striking new wooden 200 count box styled like only the artisans at Gurkha know how to do. The Cask Blend’s unique flavor notes are complimented by the natural richness of the proprietary wrapper, binder and fillers. It’s a rich and complex cigar like the Gurkha brand itself. The Cask Blend boasts notes of sweet spice and rich cedar.\" http://www.gurkhacigars.com/core-brands/cask-blend-detail.html"}
