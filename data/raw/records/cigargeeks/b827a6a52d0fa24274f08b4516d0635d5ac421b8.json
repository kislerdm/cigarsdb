No, it has no pretenses of greatness, but it is a nice smoke. And at a price of one-fourth to one-fifth the cost of the name brands, it’s even more attractive. In light of its modest price, A.O.A. is really a surprisingly good tasting cigar. Perhaps that is in large measure due to Orlando Alvarez’s commitment to his family’s three generations of cigar making.\nIn his Dominican A.O.A., Alvarez uses a long filler blend of Piloto Cubano and Olor with an Olor binder. These tobaccos are the standard for the Dominican manufacturer and are known for their predictably rich flavors. Then Alvarez splurges just a bit by capping off A.O.A. with a Connecticut- Connecticut wrapper. It’s this wrapper that provides the cigar’s mildness that proves so pleasantly satisfying."}
