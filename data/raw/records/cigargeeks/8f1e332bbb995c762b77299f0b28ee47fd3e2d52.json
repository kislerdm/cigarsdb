It was un-banded, so I inquired with Brian Desind, owner of PCC, as to what it was.  His reply via email:  \"It's Mr. Z from Cordoba Y Morales! The wrapper is from AJâ€™s farm, the binder nicaraguan the filler is ometepe and the forbidden fruit.\"\n\nMy guess is \"forbidden fruit\" means Cuban tobacco, but I don't know that for sure."}
