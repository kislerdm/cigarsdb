We are talking about a master blender who was groomed by the entire staff of the once legendary Davidoff Cigar Company.  Jr. grew up obviously with his father the head of tobacco growing for the brand, but also working under Eladio Diaz the master blender of over 30 years at the brand.  His sister grows tobacco.  His family is all tobacco people.  He also does not need the money.  He is educated, smart, and wants for nothing.  He literally does not want to be a big person in our industry.  He simply wants to have a very small factory, with a few coworkers and the daily experience of being a master blender/artist.  Thatâ€™s it.  He does not care about being famous or rich.  He cares about family and being content.  Which is why he only produces around 250,000 cigars per year.  So you can see why his clients feel threatened that he works with Privada.  In fact some of them have even threatened him that if he works with us, they will not work with him.  But it did not work.  Hendrick does what he wants.  He is his own man.  Owned by no one.  So here is the 73.  His first release with PCC directly.  Named for the year of his birth.  Special.  Unique.  Exclusive.  Rare.  Privada.  Thank you Mr. Kelner for your hard work, dedication, passion, and loyalty.  You see Privada for what it really is.\"\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/hendrik-kelner-jr-for-kelner-boutique-factory-the-73/"}
