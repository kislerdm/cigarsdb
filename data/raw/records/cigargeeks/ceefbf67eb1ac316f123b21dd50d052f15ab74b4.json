We’re inviting members of the Privada Cigar Club and the Limited Cigar Association to dive into a world of flavor, skill, and tradition with us.\n\nFirst up is the Habano cigar, a real show-stopper made with top-notch Aganorsa tobacco.  It’s a big one, at 6 1/2×52, and it’s HVC’s nod to the classic Cuban cigar style, using rich Nicaraguan tobacco for a taste that’s all about tradition and quality.  Then there’s the Maduro version, ready to be discovered by LCA members this month.  It’s a chance for cigar fans to dig into something new and exciting.\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/product/the-reinier-lorenzo-privada-masterpiece/"}
