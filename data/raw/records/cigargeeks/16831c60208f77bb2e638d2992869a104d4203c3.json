The long-leaf fillers contain Dominican San Vicente tobacco from 1997 that was aged for 18 years in bales constructed from palm tree bark wrapped in palm leaves. This technique, similar to the Cuban method called entarado, allows the tobacco to slowly ferment as it ages without influence from outside temperature or humidity. After the cigars are rolled, they are aged an additional year before shipping. This beauty comes draped in an Ecuador Connecticut shade wrapper with a 1997 Dominican San Vicente binder, and 1997 Dominican San Vicente long leaves with a bit of Pennsylvania ligero to add some intensity. Quesada Reserva Privada is mild to medium-bodied with plenty of complexity and flavor, including wood, cream, mild spice, and black pepper. Due to the post production aging, supply will fluctuate as the blend is being released gradually"}
