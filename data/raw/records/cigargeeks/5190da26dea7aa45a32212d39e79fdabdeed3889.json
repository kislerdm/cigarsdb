That is 1491. This is not a blend. This is what happens when you take the original Dominican Corojo tobacco and simply make a cigar with it. This is the closest possible modern interpretation of what the great Taíno people, native to the Caribbean, were smoking before Columbus arrived. This is how amazing Dominican tobacco really is, in its purest form. These would be the cigars of a cacique– a Taíno chief.\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/1491-pre-release-herf-session-event/"}
