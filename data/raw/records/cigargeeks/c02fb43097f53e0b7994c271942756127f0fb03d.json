This blend is an exotic smoke not only for the 5 filler leaves used in this complex blend, but also because of a very special binder we used to underscore the blend. This binder is known as Habano and adds a creamy, coco flavor to the smoke. It is of the crop of 2003 (an extremely good year for the tobacco crops) and was aged carefully to pull out the best \u0026 richest flavor possible from this leaf. Featuring full earthy tones of leather and spice, this super-rich, smooth smoke was originally created in the Brazilian Maduro wrapper to enhance the woody tones of this exceptional cigar. Uncle Joey usually pairs this smoke with an Aged Scotch straight up for a \"No Nonsense\" after-dinner experience."}
