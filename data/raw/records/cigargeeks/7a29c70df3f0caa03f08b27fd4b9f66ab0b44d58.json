The wrapper is an exquisite sun-grown Cuban seed Habano leaf. The premium binder and long-fillers are also finely cured Cuban seed Habano. This blend of aged Habano tobacco provides you with an earthy, creamy taste that's well-balanced and has sweet notes of licorice, cedar, nuts, and chocolate.\nTony has been making fine cigars for years and these prove his talents. He supervises each roller in the creation of these cigars, and some of them are even made by the man himself. Wholesale cigars of this caliber are hard to find, except at Cuban Crafters. Each Churchill cigar is 7 inches long with a ring gauge of 48.\nhttps://cccrafter.com/tony-alvarez-habano-churchill-w-7-x-48-cigars/"}
