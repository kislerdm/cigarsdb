The extra-thick format offers the same harmonious coffee, oak and spice facets as the Short Robusto; the ethereal sweet and sour fruity-herbal notes also come through wonderfully. The spiciness is a little more restrained - the \"SR\" is the more intense smoke - but the Immenso comes across as all the creamier for it. Medium-bodied, superbly finished, good-natured burning!"}
