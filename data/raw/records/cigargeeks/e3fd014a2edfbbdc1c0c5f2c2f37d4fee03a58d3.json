Presented in bundles of 25, all of the cigars sport lush Habano wrappers that surround a savory core of diverse longfiller tobaccos. The smoke is exceptionally creamy with dark, earthy flavors and a spicy finish. As you would expect from Gran Habano, the quality is top-shelf, which makes this selection an even greater value. Get 'em while they last!"}
