Diamond Crown, Diamond Crown MAXIMUS and Diamond Crown Julius Caeser to our ever-popular Brick House, Perla del Mar and Cuesta-Rey, to our value-priced Quorum. Strong relationship with Arturo Fuente family \u0026 both make sticks for each other in US or Dom' republic.\n\nWrapper unattractive, very strong hay smell made me reluctant to try... Foot was strong grasses that were very dry.\nFirst nut was almost walnut then this became a bitter almond to a brazil nut. This drifted into a sweeter nougat flavour.\nBitter almond came strongly at times but was fixed with a purge blow out to make it a bit sweeter again. Mild for it's size.\n2nd third was consistently a honey nougat which reminded me of a montecristo. The wrapper had a heavenly honey, caramel, monte profile throughout.\nIn a blind test I would have stated this was either a monte or an RyJ. The body \u0026 flavour remained mild surprisingly.\nRum was the first hint of the final fruits which became raspberry \u0026 then ended beautifully on a rich blackcurrant which was strongly reminiscent of an RYJ flavour. Thoroughly enjoyable - The Churchill vitola was a bit much for me but the overall mildness compensated to leave me still wanting more, especially of that luscious blackcurrant. Burn was consistent, flavour was mild to medium in its profile \u0026 size. strength mild."}
