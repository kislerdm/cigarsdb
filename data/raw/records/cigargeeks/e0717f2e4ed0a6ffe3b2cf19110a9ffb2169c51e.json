This release is very limited. Though this cigar has the Flor Fina name it falls under the rarer side of the line which includes the 8-5-8 Sungrown. The Casa Cuba blends a golden-hued brown Ecuadorian wrapper with the delicious Dominican binder and filler synonymous with the Fuente line. This unique blend provides flavors similar to the Opus X line in a medium bodied format. The cigar has notes of wood and spice, accompanied by a sweet leathery creaminess at the finish. This is a definite must try for Fuente fans and cigar aficionados."}
