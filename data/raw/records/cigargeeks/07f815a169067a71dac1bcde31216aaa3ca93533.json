Kin to the Hitch Pin. A 6 1/6 inch cigar with a 55 ring gauge.  This is a nice size cigar.

The Twisted Hitch has it all....with a personality to boot.  Pig Tail top, with a shaggy, unfinished foot. The interior is: Cuban seed Seco. Ligero; Dominican (Piloto, Olor), and Nicaraguan. Wrapped with a sweet and spicy Brazilian Maduro wrapper. Binder is Dominican.\n \n  \n                \n   •Strength: Medium\n•Body: Full\n•Taste: Hint of Spice, Molasses, Little bit-o-nutty"}
