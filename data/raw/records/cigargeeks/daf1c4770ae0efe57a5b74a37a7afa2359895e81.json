Cunningham acquired some Flor de Cana 18-year-old rum barrels to use for aging this premium blend of Nicaraguan binder and filler tobaccos. Then, after applying a silky smooth and seamless Ecuador Sumatra wrapper, the finished cigars are returned to the rum barrels for even some more additional aging. This timely and painstaking curing process amounts to one of the richest full-flavored smokes in the Esteban Carreras portfolio."}
