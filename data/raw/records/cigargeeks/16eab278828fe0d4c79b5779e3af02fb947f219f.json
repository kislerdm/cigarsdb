This venture was initiated by Don Ramon Romeo Azul, who, driven by unrecognized talents in blending and fermenting, left a renowned Honduran factory in frustration to start his own. At his new factory, Don Ramon meticulously re-ferments tobaccos traded across the Nicaraguan-Honduran border, crafting limited batches of extraordinary cigars, including the celebrated Ramon.\n\nNamed in honor of Ramon Allones, the Ramon embodies Don Ramonâ€™s philosophy that the true spirit of a cigar extends beyond borders, focusing on masterful tobacco treatment and a harmonious blend of tradition and innovation, thereby marking a new era in cigar craftsmanship.\"\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/product/ramon-by-la-factoria-de-digbanya-aged-2-years/"}
