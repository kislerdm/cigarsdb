I hope they get better with age.  Intial light produced strong pepper flavors with a subtle sweetness.  About an inch in it moved to wood, tobbacco flavors and stayed that way to the band.  Burn was cool and consistent.  My only complaint is that it lacked more flavor.  Listed as Medium-Full I would say it was more mild-medium.  Will have to update my review in 6 months."}
