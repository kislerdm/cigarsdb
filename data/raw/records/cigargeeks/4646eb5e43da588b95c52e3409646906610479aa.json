I’m thrilled to present this exclusive blend, the fruit of a two-year collaboration with a newly co-owned factory. This partnership allows our global Privada community to exert more control over cigar production. If future creations from La Fabrica de Helados factory, located near our Tabacalera Annex in Esteli, match even half this cigar’s quality, we’ve hit a triumph. This venture permits us to experiment with diverse tobaccos, primarily guided by my intuition. While I’m no professional blender, I relish the process of crafting innovative blends.\n\nOccasionally, we craft an exceptional blend like this one. Continuous engagement with our club will enhance discernment between good and truly remarkable cigars. This, dear reader, belongs to the latter category. Despite the competitive market, I won’t unveil every detail about our Champagne Corona. However, know that the materials sourced come from top-tier, time-honoured farmers. It’s a privilege to share this outstanding creation with you. Though its ring gauge may seem small, perfection, as embodied by this cigar, requires no alteration.\""}
