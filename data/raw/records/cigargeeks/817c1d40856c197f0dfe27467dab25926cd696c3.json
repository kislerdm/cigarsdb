Mild scent. Nice easy draw, slightly ashy. If you have ever wanted a morning cigar (Aficionados, you know what Iâ€™m talking about.) this is it. Not that you cannot indulge any time of the day, but the Diplomat is the perfect accompaniment to your favorite cup of coffee. Its mild silky flavor is sure to please even the most well heeled of smokers. Even burning and smooth this cigar is one to always keep on hand."}
