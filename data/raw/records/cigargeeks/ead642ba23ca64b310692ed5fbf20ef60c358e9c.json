The cigar is well constructed with no soft spots and what appears to be a triple cap and a beautiful Maduro wrapper with shallow intricate veins. This is a full bodied spicy cigar. There are lingering hints of semi sweet dark chocolate and coffee that enhance and blend well with the spicy flavor. I picked up some very slight hint of vanilla for the first half of the smoke. The last third of this cigar became a little more peppery than I like but still a nice flavorful smoke. All and all, this is a 4 star cigar with a 5 star price."}
