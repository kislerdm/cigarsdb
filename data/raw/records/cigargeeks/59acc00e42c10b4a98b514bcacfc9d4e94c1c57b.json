A Nicaraguan Sumatra binder, makes for an even burn and white ash. The Nicaraguan filler adds the bold tobacco flavors from the rich volcanic soil of Esteli and Condega regions with the sweet tobaccos from Jalapa Valley. This blend produces a smooth medium to full body smoke with hints of caramel, toasted coconut, and subtle notes of spice."}
