Hucklebuck.  A great Cuban Seed wrapper. B-E-A ...utiful cigar.  You will love it.  Dominican and Nicaraguan filler.  Dominican binder.  Just a splendid cigar with a \"mountain folk\" name.  \n\nIt's a whole new \"flavor\" profile for Flatbed Cigar Co. Our PANACEA Red label (habano) has a Cuban seed binder, but the wrapper is a Brazilian maduro.  The HUCKLEBUCK Habano is a Cuban seed wrapper.  The \"Buck\" is a strong cigar compared to the PANACEA Red.  Smokey, nutty, earthy, with a hint of maple.\n\nFull Body, and lots of smoke from this 6x52 Toro."}
