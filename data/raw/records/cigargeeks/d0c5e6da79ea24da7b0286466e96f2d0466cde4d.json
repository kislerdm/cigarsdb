According to Erik, this gentleman spared no expense making these cigars. They used very expensive Rosado wrappers from Ecuador and great fillers and binders as well. Erik was very proud of the work he did with this brand, but in the end, the brand sold and is now defunct. This is around the time we started Privada. With the word of this brand closing doors I started my hunt. I called the sales reps, the manufacturer and even the owner. On all fronts, I was told the dead stock product will not be for sale. This is before I met Erik Espinosa. A few years later Iâ€™m with Erik and I remind him that I once tried to contact him about these cigars, and to my surprise he grins and tells me he still might have about 5k of the toro and 6k of the Robusto, and he needs to get rid of them already as they have been taking up too much space in his aging rooms. That, my friends, is what happens when you let people like us with real passion into an industry like cigars. Let us relish these rare moments where fate takes over and we benefit from it. Enjoy this aged Nicaraguan cigar as your first cigar of the day, please!\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/the-day-off-robusto-aged-5-years-made-at-la-zona-espinosa/\n\nPCC monthly selection for Dec.
