The blend was designed strong enough for the more experienced palate yet smooth enough for the beginner to enjoy. The box press allows for an even, uniform draw. The initial draw starts off spicy; intriguing the seasoned smoker and catching the novice off-guard. The hints of earthiness with cocoa will continue to excite the palate and create a smooth, medium bodied smoke. The chocolatey profile stays throughout the smoke. Black pepper notes become apparent and continue during this pleasurable experience. This medium-bodied cigar is a must buy for the aficionado and is a great chance for the beginner to take the leap into the next level."}
