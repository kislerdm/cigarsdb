It can mean one of a few things; the owner is shilling a cigar purchased affordably for a higher profit margin, the owner has a wonderful palate and can blend their own great cigar or the owner has developed a solid relationship with someone that can blend them a fine cigar. The latter is where we land with this House cigar. Bayron Duarte \u0026 Oscar Valladares have become friends of Tobaccology over the years and helped us with this blend! It is a Corojo wrapped cigar with Nicaraguan and Honduran guts. It smokes very well and we are always excited for smokers to give it a try!! Please let us know what you think once you've smoked them?!\n\nhttps://tobaccology.com/product/tobaccology-by-oscar/"}
