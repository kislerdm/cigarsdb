It was a such a popular social media event that it caught the attention of My Father Cigars, who generously matched the funds raised. This was the beginning of The Little Robusto Project. From retailers to bloggers, there was enough support for the project that My Father Cigars produced a special edition “Little Robusto” Series JJ cigar to raise money for SIDS."}
