Some of you were lucky enough to smoke the Xhaxhi Bobi Halloween themed cigar that he made for the LCA in October. For those of you who were not, you are welcome! The cigar was a hit. What we did not mention in the release is that we made another batch of very similar cigars for the holiday season. There really is not much difference between the two except that the LCA release had more Dominican filler and this has more Nicaraguan filler. If you missed it, Xhaxhi Bobi is a Dutch cigar box maker who is a rockstar among the Dominican cigar makers. On any given day, you will find Bobi traveling between factories with a bottle in one hand and a box of cigars in the other. He is a wild guy who likes to prank and scare people. I cannot tell you how often I am on FaceTime with a cigar maker and Bobi jumps into the screen. Overall Bobi brings cheer to the people he works with, and this cigar should bring cheer to you as well!\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/xhaxhi-bobi-grinchy-aged-9-months/\n\nPCC monthly selection for Dec.
