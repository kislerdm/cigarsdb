The band is in a language called Guarani, native to the jungles of South America. The band has a classic, industrial aesthetic that I love. I started working with a factory in Brazil about a year ago. They initially sent me cigars and to be quite honest I was not in love. They later introduced me to a small factory in Paraguay, whose cigars I did actually love. They use Dominican tobacco and have a sister factory in the Dominican Republic. I did my best to explain what Privada Cigar Club is all about and a week later I got another package, which had this cigar in it. My understanding is they have a client who is in the dairy industry that makes cigars for its company each year. They do not roll the cigars in Paraguay. They ship up a very long filler viso called Flojo which they claim originated in Africa. In the Dominican Republic they blend this tobacco with more traditional tobaccos to create a beautiful smoking experience. This is a medium bodied cigar with a beautiful bouquet of cream, florals and light baking spices. See if you notice a difference in flavors from other Dominican puro cigars you have smoked in the past or smoke them side by side to see what difference this Flojo tobacco has made.\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/product/nandysy/"}
