They sent samples of an aged cigar they had in their factory. The wrapper is from Brazil. Their team loves the cigar very much and have been smoking them for personal consumption but due to FDA regulations cannot sell the blend with their branding on it. I call it the RIO. It has a rare combination of Brazilian wrapper and Brazilian binder. Dominican and Nicaraguan fillers. Aged 2.5 years in the Dominican Republic.\"\n\nNow in the Privada shop:  https://privadacigarclub.com/shop/black-bird-cigar-co-the-rio-restock/"}
