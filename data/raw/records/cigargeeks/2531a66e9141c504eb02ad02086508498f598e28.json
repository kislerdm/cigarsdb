Some lament that the profits from tobacco sales are benefitting other countries. After Alec Bradley’s sale, I received a call from Raíces Cubanas, the factory that produces Alec Bradley’s cigars. They had a shipment of unbanded cigars ready for sale that had been resting and aging. Sampling these, I found them exceptional. These cigars might have been Alec Bradley’s next major release, and it’s a pity we’ll never know their intended name. It’s especially disheartening to see Alec Bradley, once a family-owned American company, sell to an offshore corporation and witness some family members even join the new owners, a sign of shifting times in our industry.\""}
