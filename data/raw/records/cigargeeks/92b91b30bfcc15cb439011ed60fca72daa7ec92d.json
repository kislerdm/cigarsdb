This blend has enough flavor present to let you know you are enjoying a great cigar without presenting any heavy or deep tones. A wonderful cigar any time of day when smoked in the creamy Connecticut Shade.\n\n Interestingly enough, when this blend is paired with the walnut toned Ecuador Oscuro Wrapper, it takes on a completely different character; becoming a bolder smoke with rich earth tones and much fuller spicy presentation on the tongue. In the Ecuador Oscuro, this blend moves confidently into the Medium Body category.\n\nNote of  Interest - The name \"La India\" refers to the female warriors of the Taino Indian tribe of Puerto Rico. It is of  interest to note that this blend smokes so differently in the Connecticut Shade Wrapper vs. the Ecuador Oscuro Wrapper. This blend definately shows two distinct  personalities when you compare your smoking experience in the two wrappers."}
