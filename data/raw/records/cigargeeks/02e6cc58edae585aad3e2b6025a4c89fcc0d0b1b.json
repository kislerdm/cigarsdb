Legends narrate that a Benedictine monk brought in\n\nBrenta Valley the tobacco’s seed that he had hidden in the hollow of his walking stick coming back home from the America, which was just conquered. This could be only a legend but also a truth, what it is sure is that in Italy the tobacco appeared for the first time in Campese in the Brenta Valley in the end of the sixteenth century, thanks to the monks that here had a monastery; this became, during the years, the only cultivation of the area. In 2002 the Association decided to give a new life to the tobacco tradition of the Valley, and in 2012 l’Antico Sigaro Nostrano del Brenta 1763 debuted in the market. The first born of this family is: IL DOGE, entirely hand made by the cigar maker in the Campese factory,  according to a process pass down from generation to generation for more than 4 centuries.\n\nThe cigar is made with bands and subbands earlier fermented and modelled; after that the cigar’s extremities are trimmed with specific guillotines that remove the protrusions. Now we can say that the cigar is done but before smoke it, it must reach a normal level of humidity. For this reason the cigars are put in perforated framework with n. batch, production date and type of stuffing, which in turn are put in specific drying and maturation room. The phase of packing is made by the cigar makers that also check the quality of the colour and the entirety of cigars."}
