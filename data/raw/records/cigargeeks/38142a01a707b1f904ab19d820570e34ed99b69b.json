This requires utmost precision in not only rolling but also the blending of the 8 different tobaccos with a combined age 60 years. Despite the absence of the wrapper, the beginning of the cigar is very enjoyable and exemplifies a high skillset in craftsmanship, as Davidoff's Master Blenders created an intriguing switch in taste and sensation as soon as the wrapper leaf comes in with added depth and complexity of flavours.\n\nhttps://halfwheel.com/davidoff-limited-edition-2024-year-of-the-dragon-arrives/431677/"}
