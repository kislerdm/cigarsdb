The notes that came with it say this:\n\n\"Ever wonder what the most expensive and elegant Connecticut shade cigars of yesteryear would taste like after being professionally aged 12 years? No need to wonder any longer. Last year we had a cigar in October called Pumpkin. It donned the same label, but with a different name. It was the Rothschild (short robusto) version of this cigar. It was also two years older than this cigar. Like the Treat cigar in this very same pack, this cigar comes from the most prestigious brands in our industry. This is the cigar most rich guys around the world would reach for when they weren't smoking a Cuban. Why? Because of the branding, the history, the care taken for the product. Like them or not, no brand works harder at releasing AAA+ rated products the way this company does. This cigar has a Connecticut wrapper. Dominican fillers with a hint of Peru. The aging process has taken nothing from the cigar by way of flavor. I am so proud to be able to enjoy this with you. Thank you so much for helping us realize our dreams of finding the best cigars in the world by supporting Privada.\""}
