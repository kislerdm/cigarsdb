On paper, the wrappers are the same leaf, CT Broadleaf, but the age significantly altered the leaf because of just natural variation in aging that happened during the process, so the wrapper used for the re-release seems like quite a different experience, despite being the same type of leaf. So even though they seem like the same components, the overall experience is quite different.\""}
