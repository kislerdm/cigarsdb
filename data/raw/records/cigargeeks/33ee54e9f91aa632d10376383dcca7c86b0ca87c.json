Carlos is the grandson of renown Cuban grower and blender Alejandro Robaina. This cigar has a leathery Habano  wrapper with a unique earthy tobacco aroma. A smooth draw gives way to slight white pepper notes  and leads into  a creamy nutty flavour. The Agis is an unlabeled  short fill with all the flavour of the Long Fill  Magno Inception Series"}
