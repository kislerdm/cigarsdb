Opium by George Rico - a limited-edition release from one of the most creative minds in the industry. The name may throw you for a loop, but rest assured the cigars are legit and completely legal. Hailing from George Rico's boutique factory in Honduras, each Opium comes packed with rich, savory tobaccos. At play is a reddish brown Nicaraguan Habano Corojo hybrid wrapper, boasting an oily sheen and generous tooth. Nestled beneath this leaf awaits a Nicaraguan binder hugging a top-secret proprietary blend of aged long-fillers. You're left with smooth yet assertive medium to full-bodied smoke, brimming with hints of cedar, leather, spices, coffee, and a dash of pepper. It's safe to say that Opium demands your attention, and it's well deserved."}
