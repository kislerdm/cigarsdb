Born into the industry in 1907, Angel and his family have been providing the entire industry with premium-quality tobacco leaf, leaves used by the majority of today’s top cigar makers. Before you ask, this is not the Oliva family that makes the Serie ‘O’. Rather, this is the Oliva family that has built an empire as one of the largest tobacco growers in the world."}
