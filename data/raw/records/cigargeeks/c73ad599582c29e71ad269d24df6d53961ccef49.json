They scoured multiple locations before choosing their 11th farm, selected after Mr. Prieto tasted the soil and found it perfect for their venture. This team then daringly transported seeds from Cuba to Nicaragua, initiating the growth process. Their Habano box press is an exclusive Nicaraguan puro, with the majority of the cigar sourced from their chosen farm. The result of this meticulous process and careful sourcing is what many consider some of the finest cigars globally.\""}
