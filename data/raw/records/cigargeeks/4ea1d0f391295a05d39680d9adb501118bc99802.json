Although overshadowed by the more familiar Fuente line of cigars, my good friends at Tenorio recently sent over several cigars and challenged me to take a blind taste test against ANY cigar out there. The blend of Cuban seed that is in all Tenorio cigars was very evident throughout the long lasting smoke and the cigars had a very pleasant aroma and burned evenly. Available in 5 different sizes--Churchill, Extra Corona, Corona, Robusto, and Panatela--Tenorio cigars are packed in hand made cedar boxes and come with or without individual cellophane. Tenorio currently has 78 employees working in its factory producing their line of cigars exclusively; in addition, they have the capacity of producing more than 300,000 cigars per month--which means they have plenty of product available and aggressive pricing to match. Everybody on our taste panel agreed this is an excellent cigar."}
