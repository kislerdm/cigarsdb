In this case, we are very lucky to have a confirmed Nicaraguan grown and rolled cigar in which most of the tobacco comes from a single estate.  This is truly rare.  AJ Fernandez has given us another classic Nicaraguan Habano that will take you on a journey to the soul of the country itself.  When you smoke this cigar you will not have to wonder why Nicaragua has become the new Cuba in many aspects.  Tobacco this naturally flavorful is a phenomenon and should be given your utmost attention.\""}
