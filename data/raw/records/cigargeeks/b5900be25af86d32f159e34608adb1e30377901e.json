I wanted it to taste and feel just like the Cuban Partagas No. 4, which is one of my favorites. After a long and careful process of aging in coolers, I think it’s finally ready to be smoked. During these two years, Noel has really started to make a name for himself in the cigar industry, and I like to think that I had a small part in that. We’ve done some cool stuff together, like making unique blends on our YouTube channel and creating exclusive cigars that people just can’t seem to get enough of. One of our big hits was the Peruvian Gold. My goal in working with folks like Noel is to make sure we both benefit from our collaborations. It’s all about give and take, right? I believe this approach strengthens relationships and helps us both be more successful in what we do. Now, after all this time and work, I can’t wait to sit back and enjoy this special cigar. It’s more than just a cigar to me; it’s a symbol of the hard work and passion we both put into the art of making cigars.\""}
