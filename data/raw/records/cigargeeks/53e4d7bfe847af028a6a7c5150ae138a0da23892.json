It was in Privada's monthly subscription box for May '22.\n\n\"My friends, what you hold in your hands is the last cigar Dr. Gaby Kafie will produce in Honduras for a very long time. While I hope he makes his way back to his home country, for now he is beginning production in the Dominican Republic. I cannot supply details on why he left, but I can tell you this cigar almost did not make it to us. Had we waited one more week the cigar would have been held in Honduras indefinitely. When the cigar arrived, I wanted to age it and over time I tried it every now and then. Today it is ready to smoke. It has a lot of the nuances I will miss about Kafieâ€™s production in Honduras. There is an apple pie thing I get out of a lot of the cigars he made there and this is a testament to that. Kafie makes this cigar for Alex Spencer Reserve, a brand out of Cincinnati that caught industry attention about 2 years ago.\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/the-mansa-parejo-aged-1-year-pcc-exclusive/"}
