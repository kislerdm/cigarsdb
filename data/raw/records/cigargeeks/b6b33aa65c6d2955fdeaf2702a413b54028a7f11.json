The notes that came with it say this:\n\n\"This is the cigar that led up to a very exquisite release in 2017. The wrapper is an Ecuadorian hybrid habano that was later noted by 3 numbers. Cuban seed, expertly grown and cross-bred to create a wrapper leaf like no other. You will not find this on any other cigar in the world. If you wanted to purchase the present-day variation of this cigar you would spend around $90 for a 4 pack. Deep in the heart of the Dominican Republic there are aging rooms filled with brown gold in the form of cigars. The cigar you have in your hand was crafted by the world's best growers, blenders, and most prestigious brand. It is an honor to not only smoke this cigar, but to be able to share it with all of our members. Long Live Privada. This is what we are capable of together. Thank you for your continued support, it is an honor to serve!\""}
