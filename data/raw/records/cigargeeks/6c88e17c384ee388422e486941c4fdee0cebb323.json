Ehrlich Tremont line, using a Mexican San Andrés maduro wrapper in place of that line’s Ecuadorian sumatra wrapper. The Nicaraguan binder from Estelí remains the same, as does the filler blend that is primarily Nicaraguan tobacco from Estelí and Condega, with some tobacco grown on the La Canela farm in the Dominican Republic."}
