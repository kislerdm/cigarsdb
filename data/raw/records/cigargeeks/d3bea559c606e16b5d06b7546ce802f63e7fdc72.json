If you do not know the story please search for mad monkey cigars on YouTube. It is one of our more theatrical videos and it certainly adds to the smoking experience. So the Mad Monkey himself was spotted about a year ago in Nicaragua. In between looting bodegas and bars, he stopped at Tabacalera Perla where he arm-wrestled Tony Barrios of Stallone Cigars. After Tonyâ€™s quick loss Tony agreed, under duress, to blend Mad Monkey a cigar using only the finest and fullest flavored Nicaraguan tobaccos. The monkey also stole some of the wrapper leaves from the adjacent factory owned by a man named Pepin. After several days of angst under the pressure and hostility of the monkey, Tony re-emerged from his blending lab with the cigar you now hold in your hand. By this point, the monkey was gone. Here we are almost a year later and the monkey never returned for his cigars. Where are you Mad Monkey? There have been sightings of the monkey from Costa Rica to San Antonio. Cigar Heists are happening more frequently.\""}
