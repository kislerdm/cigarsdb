'21.\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/aj-fernandez-s**t-show-lonsdale/\n\n\"Privada is a community. For some, a family. And this cigar right here is a testament to that. The s**t Show Crew is composed of some of our longest standing members. Midwest guys with a love for the leaf. Privada members ’til death, and most importantly GOOD people. This cigar commemorates a night the four main members of the Show Crew spent in New Orleans. Shout out to NOLA and the entire state of Louisiana, you are in our thoughts. I cannot think of a more suitable city to have the kind of night we recall as a s**t SHOW. We have all had them. Drunk or sober. Those times when things just get crazy. So here is to the s**t Show Crew and all of the members of Privada Cigar Club. May your s**t shows be safe and create a whole lot of memories. I’m quite sure you are about to make a cigar memory with this example of maduro perfection that the King of Nicaraguan Tobacco AJ Fernandez has blended especially for us. Another taste of what is to come in 2022!\""}
