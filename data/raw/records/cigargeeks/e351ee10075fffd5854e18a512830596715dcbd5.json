It is just so because meticulous care must be taken to insure that the crown does not flower while the tobacco is maturing in the field. Requiring constant vigilance, the grower must cut off the buds at the precise moment they are about to flower. This time-consuming and expensive process is well worth it as it gives this unique tobacco its extra rich and exquisite flavor."}
