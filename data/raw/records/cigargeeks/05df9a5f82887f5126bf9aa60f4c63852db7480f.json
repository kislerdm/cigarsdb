This project was very special to us since we call Tarpon Springs, Florida home and have always had a strong appreciation of the area's history and of the local cigar business in the Tampa area. \n \nThe original artwork of this cigar label depicts some of Tarpon Springs first residents, The Greeks who are portrayed on the label performing their craft of Sponge Diving, something which they started back in the early 1920's and still do to this day here in the area. Sponge Diving turned Tarpon Springs into \"The Sponge Capital of the World\", and our cigar brand pays tribute to the men who earned a living doing this, and in turn helped shape a whole community. I truly hope all of you enjoy my family's \"Tarpon Sponger\" ™Cigars as much as we enjoy creating them for you to smoke. Thank You, Arnold Serafin \n \nOur Tarpon Sponger cigars are made with the finest blend of Cuban seed tobaccos and rolled to perfection by our Expert Cuban Rollers to make a smooth, mild cigar. They are available in the following sizes:\n \nChurchill, Robusto, Torpedo, and Double Corona."}
