The creamy Shade wrapper screams mild cigar but it is hiding a big secret. The core of this cigar was designed to surprise you with its double Dominican Ligero and aged Dominican Filler and Binder we have amped it up just a bit by blending some Mexican San Andrés Wrapper leaf into the filler. This creates a full bodied and full strength core that is wrapped in that mild creaminess. We know you will enjoy this one as many have exclaimed that it is our best blend yet.\n\nhttps://fylcigars.com/about/"}
