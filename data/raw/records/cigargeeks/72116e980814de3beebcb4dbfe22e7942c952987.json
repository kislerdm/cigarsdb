This cigar is an ode to the hilarious mishaps from the Macy’s Day Thanksgiving Parade – particularly the 1927 episode where Felix the Cat, the parade’s first balloon, met a rather inflating end. Crafted at the same renowned Honduran factory that once produced Kafie cigars, Runaway Felix is a nostalgic trip that embodies the spirit and essence of that very parade.\n\nThe Parade Tale: Rewind to 1927 – an era without television, a world yet to see the majesty of the Empire State Building. For many, witnessing the first balloon, Felix the Cat, at the Macy’s Parade, was nothing short of mesmerizing. But, as fate would have it, this enchanting spectacle was marred by an unforeseen hiccup. As the parade concluded and the jubilation waned, a pressing question arose\n– how to deflate the mammoth balloon? In an amusing oversight, the\nhandlers, consumed by the grandeur of the ascent, overlooked the descent.\nAnd thus, in a decision tinged with both hilarity and desperation, they set\nFelix free. This soaring feline, in his untamed enthusiasm, ventured too close\nto the sun and met a popping end. Today, Runaway Felix cigar immortalizes\nthis moment, letting the spirit of that adventurous cat live on with every puff.\""}
