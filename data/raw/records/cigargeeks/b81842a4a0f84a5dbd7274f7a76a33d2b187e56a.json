It is best described as having mega-flavor for a light cigar. Built to please a European palette accustomed to richer tobacco blends,  this cigar makes our Master Roller homesick every time he smokes one! \n\nThe earthy aromas, the traditional long white ash, and the melding of light spice and leather flavors in this blend are so authentic, you can simply close your eyes and let your senses transport you to the Golden Age of Old Havana cigar production. This blend celebrates the heritage \u0026 noble tradition of hand crafting serious cigars. \n\nIt  is a stellar smoke in the light and creamy Connecticut Shade Wrapper."}
