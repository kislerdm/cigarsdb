They donate a portion of their proceeds to K9’s For Warriors. A charity that rescues dogs, trains them and then pairs them with soldiers who have PTSD. WOW. What an amazing cause. Aside from doing good, they also make excellent cigars. They work out of a factory in Nicaragua in Esteli called Tabacalera Choro. The thing I like about their cigars is they are very professional. If you want to know what I mean by that, take a look at the cigar. It’s near perfect. Construction, near perfect. Flavors, near perfect. I feel like we found a hidden gem with these guys. The brand and the factory. Expect more from them. Ironically, in a business where every manufacturer wants to be famous in the industry, these folks want nothing but to make a great cigar and enjoy the freedoms of this great nation while helping soldiers get back on their feet. Apparently, they started making cigars at this factory a couple of years ago and this was their first blend. I’m honored to support the good cause, we can feel good about this one for sure. Maybe give K9’s For Warriors or Caliber Cigar Co. a shout on social media.\""}
