'21 Brian's Box from Privada CC.  Has a foot band that says \"Limited Cigar Association\" and \"Collector's Series\" and PCC released a youtube video where it was mentioned this is intended to be an LCA release at some point. There was also mention in the video that this stick is referred to as being part of the \"Tiffany series\", whatever that is. I also had an email from Brian Desind (owner of PCC) saying this is a different blend than the original Plata y Plomo, but no other details were provided."}
