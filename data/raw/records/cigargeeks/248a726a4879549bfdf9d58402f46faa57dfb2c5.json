The cigar that we released a few months ago in the Limited Cigar Association? If you are not following the LCA, please email us for info, you are missing out on a lot of fun! It's like a monthly scavenger hunt! Anyhow, the gentleman that made that cigar for us is named Jochy Blanco. He is a legend. Legendary grower of tobacco and legendary blender. He is known for quite possibly the finest tobacco DR has to offer. I promised to make Jochy more of a household name this year, so get used to hearing his name. The Cigabon got rave reviews but I noticed a few people said it was not full enough for them. This cigar should handle those peoples' needs. This is a dark and sultry little robusto. It's got a loose draw that reminds me of a Padron. It also has balance and complexity. I rate these cigars in the 90s for sure. I took a liberty in adding this blend to our Back to the Future series of cigars. We call it the Old Man Peabody. Old Man Peabody owned a pine farm where the Twin Pines mall is now located. Peabody has a deleted scene in the show where he pulls up in a truck with his phone number on it. Enjoy brothers and sisters... this is what it's all about, the craft, the flavor and the fun!\"\n\nMy note - there's no blend info included with this stick, so I'm guessing it's probably a DR puro."}
