So what we have now is a 3 year aged cigar that has spent the last 3 months in freshly emptied bourbon barrels. The process was documented on our YouTube page so if you have not seen it, check it out. This process of bourbon barrel or even barrel aging cigars is brand new. No one else has done it this way. Most companies that use the term barrel aged are simply fermenting tobacco or portions of the tobacco to be used in a cigar and then airing them out before using them in a blend. I cannot find evidence of anyone else doing this, let alone for 10,000 cigars. I understand why, too. It can be problematic and extremely time consuming. The barrels must be checked often. The humidity is near impossible to regulate and the aroma could destroy certain cigars. But this is what makes us Privada. We now have more experience in post production cigar aging than any other company in the world with the exception of a few cigar banks in Europe. Get ready, you are about to smoke a small part of what will become cigar history.\"\n\nhttps://privadacigarclub.com/shop/blackbird-x-penelope-barrel-aged-minnesota-fats/"}
