They grow their own tobacco in a small valley in Ecuador.  Everything about these cigars is meticulous, from the packaging down to the construction of the cigars.  Speaking of the construction; Buena Vista cigars are all rolled by Master Rollers who go to Cancun on six month work visas.  So all their cigars are rolled by Master Rollers trained in some of the best factories in Cuba.  When you purchase a box of 10 there is a small card in the box with a short bio on the cigar roller who actually rolled your cigars.  \n\nThe cigar are medium bodied and have a creamy flavor with some hints of dark chocolate sweetness.  They use just a touch of aged Dominican tobacco for the filler so there's any underlying flavor of cedar and spice."}
